## Geographic Setting

### Primary Locations

**Al-Qurnah Region (Traditional "Garden of Eden")**
- Confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers
- Located in southern Iraq
- Until 1980s destruction: largest wetland ecosystem in western Eurasia
- The Mesopotamian marshes resembled their antediluvian state until just 40-45 years ago
- Dramatic 1980s-90s destruction: drained from ~20,000 km² to ~10% of original extent
- Current state (2024): recovering to ~58% of pre-drainage area
- Historical parallel: Okavango Delta, Danube Delta, pre-drainage Everglades

**Eridu (First City)**
- Archaeological dating: Founded ~5400-5300 BCE (Ubaid period)
- Located on delta coast (before Persian Gulf receded)
- Earliest structures: small temples to Enki built on virgin sand
- No prior settlement - true founding city
- Peak: Uruk period (4000-3100 BCE)
- Abandoned ~600 BCE
- In normalized timeline: approximately contemporary with Awan's lifetime

**Geographic Distance**
- Al-Qurnah to where Eridu ruins stand: ~70 km (43 miles)
- In antediluvian period: Persian Gulf extended much farther north
- Eridu was coastal; Al-Qurnah would have been more inland marsh
- Travel time: 1-2 days by boat, longer overland

### Morphodynamic Context (From Giosan & Goodman Paper)

**Critical Finding:** Tidal influence shaped early Sumerian civilization

**Tidal Irrigation Period (~7000-5500 years ago)**
- Tigris and Euphrates had separate channels to Persian Gulf
- Tidal freshwater reached far inland (similar to modern Amazon)
- Maximum tidal reach: established along incised valleys of both rivers
- Created ideal agricultural conditions at marsh edges
- Self-regulating system: floods deposited sediments, ebbs flushed salts
- No sophisticated canal networks needed initially

**Why This Matters for Awan:**
- Agriculture possible without advanced engineering
- Natural flood/tide cycle provided irrigation
- Marsh-edge farming sustainable for generations
- Explains rapid urbanization without prerequisite technology
- Tidal rhythm structures daily life and agriculture

**Environmental Transition**
- ~5500 years ago: Khuzestan transversal delta expansion
- Euphrates merged with Tigris through Shatt al-Arab
- Tidal influence constricted
- Forced shift from tidal to canal irrigation
- Triggered social transformation and urbanization

## Daily Life Activities

### Agriculture: Tidal Farming

**The Revolutionary System**

Unlike later irrigation agriculture, early Mesopotamian farming at marsh edges worked WITH tidal cycles:

**Twice-Daily Rhythm**
- High tide: freshwater advances inland through channels
- Water flows onto prepared fields
- Low tide: water recedes, carrying salts back to river
- Sediment deposited, nutrients replenished
- Self-regulating, sustainable system

**Field Preparation**

*Site selection:*
- Marsh edges at precise elevation
- High enough to avoid constant flooding
- Low enough for tidal reach
- Natural levees ideal
- Observation of water patterns over seasons

*Clearing:*
- Cut reeds and remove vegetation
- Burn stubble (adds ash nutrients)
- Break ground with digging sticks or hoes
- Level field roughly
- Create low berms to guide water

**The Planting Cycle**

*Spring (After Flood Season)*

**Timing is critical:**
- Wait for major floods to recede (March-April)
- Soil must be wet but not submerged
- Plant when tides predictable
- Too early = seeds wash away
- Too late = insufficient growing season

**Seed preparation:**
- Select best seed from previous harvest
- Keep separate from eating grain
- May soak seeds to speed germination
- Calculate amount needed per field
- Anxiety: what if harvest fails?

**Planting method:**
- Broadcasting: scatter seed by hand
- Requires skill for even distribution
- Or: dibble holes with stick, drop seeds
- Light covering with soil using feet or tools
- Prayer/offering to ensure success?

**Summer (Growing Season)**

**Tidal management:**
- Morning high tide irrigates fields
- Evening high tide provides second watering
- Natural schedule, no labor needed
- Must monitor water levels
- Adjust berms if tide too high or too low

**Ongoing maintenance:**
- Weed removal (constant battle)
- Protect from birds eating seeds
- Watch for pest infestations
- Repair berms if water breaks through
- Thin overcrowded seedlings
- Chase away grazing animals
- Daily inspection walks

**Physical experience:**
- Walking muddy fields in morning cool
- Bending to pull weeds
- Sun exposure as day heats
- Feet and legs caked with mud
- Mosquitoes and biting flies
- Back aches from stooping
- Hands rough and cut from plant stems

**Fall (Harvest)**

**Harvest timing:**
- Grain heads turn golden
- Stalks dry and brittle
- Seeds mature and hard
- Too early = low yield
- Too late = shattering (seeds fall to ground)
- Must harvest within narrow window
- Entire family mobilized

**Harvest process:**
- Cut stalks with flint sickles
- Rhythmic slicing motion
- Gather stalks into bundles
- Tie bundles with reed rope
- Carry to threshing area
- Heavy, awkward loads
- Race against weather

**Threshing and winnowing:**
- Spread stalks on hard-packed earth
- Beat with sticks to separate grain
- Or: have animals trample
- Winnowing: toss grain in air
- Wind blows away chaff
- Grain falls back to ground
- Collect clean grain

**Storage:**
- Must be completely dry
- Pack in clay jars or woven baskets
- Seal to keep out moisture and pests
- Elevated storage to prevent rot
- Constant checking for spoilage
- This grain must last until next harvest

**The Emotional Weight:**
- Relief if harvest is good
- Anxiety if yield is poor
- Pride in full storage jars
- Fear of winter hunger
- Gratitude to land/gods/ancestors
- Exhaustion after weeks of intense labor

### Herding (Sheep and Goats)

**Daily Herding Cycle**

**Early Morning:**
- Wake before dawn
- Check overnight pen for predator attacks

## Social Organization

### Family Structure

**Patriarchal:**
- Male lineage emphasized in Genesis
- But women's labor essential
- Extended family units
- Multiple generations together

**Marriage Patterns:**
- Cross-sibling marriages mentioned (Cain-Awan, etc.)
- Limited population = limited choices
- Marriage creates alliances between family groups
- Women "given" in marriage

**Children:**
- High birth rate needed (high infant mortality)
- Children as labor
- Education through participation
- No formal schooling

### Division of Labor

**Gendered:**

**Men:**
- Herding
- Hunting
- Heavy agricultural work (clearing, plowing)
- Building
- Defense
- Ritual leadership?

**Women:**
- Food preparation
- Grinding grain
- Weaving, spinning
- Childcare
- Light agricultural work (weeding, harvest)
- Water carrying
- Gathering
- Some fishing

**Children:**
- Tending small animals
- Carrying
- Gathering
- Learning by observation and imitation
- Gradually take on adult tasks

### Economic System

**Subsistence:**
- Produce what you consume
- Little surplus initially
- Storage for lean times critical

**Barter/Trade:**
- No currency
- Exchange goods directly
- Specialization enables trade
- Example: fish for grain, leather for tools

**Specialization** (Gradually Developing)
- Some people become expert potters
- Others expert weavers
- Eventually: full-time craftspeople
- Requires agricultural surplus to support non-farmers

- Or purely bad luck
- Natural causation (injury) vs. mysterious (illness)

**Treatments:**

**Practical:**
- Clean wounds with water
- Pressure to stop bleeding
- Binding/splinting broken bones
- Rest for illness

**Herbal:**

### Death

**Causes:**
- Childbirth (leading cause for women)
- Infant mortality (very high)
- Injuries
- Infections
- Old age (rare)
- Accidents
- Violence
- Famine

**Burial:**
- Abel's murder: first human death (Genesis 4:8)
- No precedent for death rituals
- Must invent mourning, burial

## Document Purpose

This consolidates all research on the physical environment, ecology, daily activities, technologies, and sensory details needed to make Awan's world tangible and real. Use this to ground scenes in specific, embodied experiences that show rather than tell.

**Key Principle:** Every detail should serve the story. Don't info-dump - let Awan's hands know these textures, her nose know these smells, her body feel this labor.

**Last Updated:** Compiled during project consolidation from conversations about Mesopotamian ecology, marsh life, agricultural systems, daily activities, and sensory worldbuilding.
