# Plants in Jewish Texts: Creation Through Noah's Flood

**The biblical and rabbinic sources name surprisingly few specific plant species for the antediluvian period.** Genesis 1-11 explicitly mentions only three common plants by name: fig trees, olive trees (during the flood), and thorns/thistles (as curse vegetation). Rabbinic literature adds significant detail, identifying flaxseed as Cain's offering and proposing wheat, grapes, figs, or etrog as candidates for the Tree of Knowledge. However, the texts consistently use generic categories—"herbs," "fruit trees," "seed-bearing plants"—rather than cataloging specific crops. This creates a stark contrast between what the texts actually state versus what scholars often assume about ancient Near Eastern agriculture.

## What Genesis 1-11 explicitly states about vegetation

The Torah's Creation account in Genesis 1:11-12 establishes three botanical categories on the third day: **deshe' (grass/vegetation)**, **'eseb mazria zera (seed-bearing herbs/plants)**, and **'etz pri (fruit trees bearing fruit with seed)**. These represent functional groups rather than species inventories. Genesis 1:29-30 specifies that humans received "every herb bearing seed" and "every tree yielding seed" as food, while animals received "every green herb"—establishing a vegetarian diet that rabbinic sources confirm lasted until Noah, covering the entire 1,656-year antediluvian period according to Talmud Sanhedrin 59b.

The Genesis 2:5-6 account introduces an important distinction not present in Chapter 1: **"plant of the field" (siah hassadeh)** and **"herb of the field" ('eseb hassadeh)**. Biblical scholars note these terms specifically denote wild shrubs and cultivated grain respectively, and critically, Genesis states these did not exist until after man's creation, distinguishing them from the general Day 3 vegetation. This textual detail reveals intentional categorization between spontaneous creation and agriculture requiring human cultivation.

Genesis never names the forbidden fruit species. The Hebrew text simply calls it "the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis 2:17, 3:3, 3:6). The widespread "apple" association appears nowhere in Jewish scripture—this derives from later Latin wordplay where "malum" means both "evil" and "apple." The only specific tree Genesis names in Eden besides the two special trees is the **fig tree (te'enah)** in Genesis 3:7, when Adam and Eve "sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings." This explicit mention makes figs the first ordinary botanical species identified in Scripture.

## Agriculture after Eden: thorns, thistles, and toil

Genesis 3:17-19 describes agricultural consequences of the Fall with notable precision about what changes. God curses **the ground (adamah)** itself, declaring "thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the herb of the field." The Hebrew terms **qots (thorns)** and **dardar (thistles)** represent the first explicit mention of troublesome weedy vegetation. Significantly, the text does not say these plants were newly created—only that the cursed ground would now produce them alongside crops.

The phrase "herb of the field" ('eseb hassadeh) appearing in Genesis 3:18 connects back to Genesis 2:5's pre-human agriculture terminology. This indicates a shift from eating freely available garden fruits to consuming cultivated plants requiring labor. Genesis 3:19 emphasizes the work: "In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground." The text focuses on agricultural difficulty and toil rather than specifying particular crops. Rabbi Eliezer's commentary in Genesis Rabbah suggests that without a "new blessing upon the earth, it would have brought forth nothing else" but thorns and thistles, and this curse "made it hard and difficult to the antediluvian patriarchs to get their bread."

## Cain's offering: the flaxseed tradition

Genesis 4:3 states that "Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD." The Hebrew phrase **"min-peri ha-adamah"** literally means "from the fruit/produce of the ground"—using "peri" (fruit/produce) in its broad agricultural sense, not necessarily tree fruits. **Genesis does not name any specific crop.** This generic terminology contrasts sharply with Abel's detailed offering of "the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions" (Genesis 4:4).

Rabbinic literature fills this gap with specific identifications. **Midrash Tanchuma Bereishit 9 explicitly states: "There is an Agada which says that it was linseed/flaxseed."** This represents the most botanically precise identification in rabbinic sources for Cain's crops. Rashi's 11th-century commentary, citing earlier traditions, confirms this flaxseed identification while also noting Genesis Rabbah 22:5's emphasis that Cain brought "the most inferior" produce—"like a bad tenant who eats the first ripe figs but honors the king with the late figs." The contrast between Abel's "firstlings" and Cain's inferior leftovers becomes central to rabbinic interpretation of why God rejected Cain's offering.

Some rabbinic sources connect this to the shatnez prohibition against mixing wool (from Abel's sheep) with linen/flax (from Cain's plants), symbolically separating these two brothers' offerings. Interestingly, **the Book of Jubilees 4:2 does not specify what Cain offered**—despite generally adding details absent from Genesis, Jubilees only mentions "the offering of Cain" without botanical particulars.

## The Tree of Knowledge debate: four rabbinic candidates

Genesis Rabbah 15:7, one of the earliest comprehensive midrashic collections (circa 400-450 CE), preserves four explicit rabbinic opinions about the Tree of Knowledge's botanical identity:

**Wheat (חיטים)** according to Rabbi Meir, who reasoned that "a child does not know how to call 'father' and 'mother' until he tastes grain." This connects cereal consumption with human sapience and speech development. Talmud Berakhot 40a and Sanhedrin 70a-b discuss this theory, treating wheat as the catalyst for acquiring knowledge.

**Grapes/grapevine (ענבים)** according to Rabbi Yehuda, who argued that "nothing brings wailing to the world like wine," citing Noah's post-flood drunkenness (Genesis 9:21) as evidence that the same plant causing the Fall later caused Noah's shame. This creates narrative symmetry across the antediluvian boundary.

**Fig tree (תאנים)** according to Rabbi Nehemiah, employing the principle that "that which caused their downfall was then used to rectify them." Since Adam and Eve covered themselves with fig leaves (Genesis 3:7), the tree closest at hand—providing immediate remedy—must have been the source of the problem. This represents elegant theological reasoning from textual evidence.

**Etrog/citron** according to Rabbi Aba of Ako, based on matching Genesis 3:6's description ("pleasant to the sight and good for food") with the etrog's desirable appearance. Nachmanides notes that "etrog" in Aramaic relates to "chemda" (desirous), connecting it to Eve's desire. Some sources link this to the Sukkot ritual use of etrog as atonement for Eden's sin.

A fifth position from Rabbi Azarya and Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon maintains that "God never revealed the [type of] tree to Adam, and nor will He reveal it in the future" to protect that species' honor. This acknowledges the question's theological importance while asserting divine concealment.

## The Tree of Life: botanical scale and location

Genesis mentions the Tree of Life four times (2:9, 3:22, 3:24) but provides no botanical description. Rabbinic sources supply dramatic details absent from Scripture. **Genesis Rabbah 15:6 states that Rabbi Yehudah bar Ilai taught: "The Tree of Life extends over a journey of 500 years,"** referring to the trunk diameter requiring 500 years to traverse. The text adds that "all the waters of creation split beneath it," making it the source of Eden's rivers. This transforms a simple tree into a cosmic botanical structure.

Genesis Rabbah discusses the spatial relationship between the two special trees, describing the Tree of Knowledge as forming "a hedge around the Tree of Life"—placing the forbidden tree as a barrier protecting the life-giving tree. The dove that returned to Noah during the flood, according to Genesis Rabbah's commentary on Genesis 8:11, entered through gates that "opened for her" to the Garden of Eden, "and from there she brought" the olive branch. This suggests olive trees grew in Eden and survived the flood, connecting pre- and post-diluvian vegetation.

Talmud Ta'anit 10a provides cosmic scale: "Egypt is 400 parasangs by 400, and it is one-sixtieth of the size of Ethiopia; Ethiopia is one-sixtieth of the world, and the world is one-sixtieth of the Garden, and the Garden is one-sixtieth of Eden." This distinguishes between the Garden (Gan) where Adam lived and Eden itself—an even vaster realm. Rabbi Samuel bar Naḥamani in Berakhot 34b emphasizes that "this is Eden, which has never been seen by the eye of any creature," maintaining Eden's transcendent nature.

## What Abel's sheep grazed: textual silence

Genesis 4:2 identifies Abel as "a keeper of sheep" (ro'eh tson), but **neither Genesis nor other Jewish sources specify what vegetation his flocks grazed**. The text implies pastureland existed—sheep require forage—but no explicit mention of grass, herbs, or any particular plants appears in connection with Abel's livestock. This silence contrasts with the attention given to Cain's agriculture, suggesting the text's focus on offerings rather than comprehensive agricultural description.

Genesis 1:30 had stated that God gave animals "every green herb" (kol yerek 'eseb) for food, establishing that herbivorous animals received vegetation as sustenance. The curse in Genesis 3:17-18 affected "the ground" but did not explicitly remove animal fodder. Rabbinic sources maintain that animals continued eating vegetation throughout the antediluvian period, though they provide no species-level detail about what Abel's sheep consumed.

## Noah before the flood: agriculture and righteousness

Genesis 5:29 connects Noah's birth to agricultural hope: "This one will comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD has cursed." His father Lamech explicitly references the Genesis 3 curse, positioning Noah as somehow alleviating agricultural hardship. The text calls Noah "a righteous man, perfect in his generations" (Genesis 6:9) but provides no details about what he grew or cultivated before the flood.

**Genesis 6:21 instructs Noah: "And you shall take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and you shall gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them."** This implies gathering plant-based food stores for the ark's inhabitants but names no specific crops, fruits, or vegetables. The instruction assumes diverse food sources existed but maintains categorical rather than specific terminology.

Critically, **no vineyard appears in Genesis before the flood.** Genesis 9:20 states: "And Noah began to be a farmer, and he planted a vineyard"—this occurs explicitly after leaving the ark, making it post-flood activity. Some commentators suggest vineyards may have existed earlier, but Scripture's first mention of vineyard planting is unambiguously after the flood. The Hebrew "vayyita' kerem" (and he planted a vineyard) describes Noah's post-deluge initiative, not pre-flood conditions.

The Book of Jubilees adds significant detail: Noah planted vines in year 1317 Anno Mundi "on the mountain on which the ark had rested, named Lubar, one of the Ararat Mountains, and they produced fruit in the fourth year [1320 A.M.], and he made wine therefrom" (Jubilees 7:1-2). But even Jubilees specifies this as post-flood viticulture, not antediluvian agriculture.

## What the Book of Jubilees adds and omits

The Book of Jubilees (2nd century BCE) retells Genesis with additional details, yet **surprisingly provides less botanical specificity for the antediluvian period than one might expect**. Jubilees 2:7 describes the third day of Creation: God created "the seed which is sown, and all sprouting things, and fruit-bearing trees, and trees of the wood, and the garden of Eden"—categories matching Genesis without additional species.

**Jubilees 3:15-16 states that Adam and Eve spent seven years in Eden "tilling and keeping it,"** gathering fruit and putting aside residue for themselves. This adds temporal detail absent from Genesis but still names no specific crops. After expulsion, Jubilees 3:34-35 says Adam "tilled the land as he had been instructed in the Garden of Eden"—again emphasizing cultivation activity without botanical inventory.

**Jubilees 3:27 adds information not in Genesis:** when Adam left Eden, "he offered as a sweet savour an offering, frankincense, galbanum, and stacte, and spices in the morning with the rising of the sun." These aromatic resins and spices—**frankincense, galbanum (an aromatic gum resin), and stacte (another aromatic)—**appear nowhere in the Genesis account. This represents Jubilees' most significant botanical addition, suggesting these valuable aromatics existed from Creation and were immediately available to Adam for offerings.

Remarkably, **Jubilees 4:2 does not specify what Cain offered**, stating only that "God accepted the sacrifice of Abel, and did not accept the offering of Cain" without naming crops. This contrasts with Midrash Tanchuma's specific flaxseed identification, showing that even texts adding extrabiblical details don't always expand botanical information.

Jubilees 7:35-38 preserves a fascinating claim: **Enoch taught agricultural laws** including the three-year waiting period for fruit trees and sabbatical year release, which "Methuselah his son, and Methuselah his son Lamech, and Lamech commanded me [Noah] all the things which his fathers commanded him." This positions agricultural law as antediluvian divine revelation transmitted through the patriarchal chain, not Mosaic innovation—a theological claim elevating agriculture's sacred status while still not naming specific antediluvian crops.

## Comprehensive inventory: what is and isn't named

**Plants explicitly named in Genesis 1-11:**
- Fig tree (te'enah) - Genesis 3:7
- Olive tree (zayit) - Genesis 8:11 (olive leaf from the dove)
- Thorns (qots) - Genesis 3:18

- Vineyard (kerem) - Genesis 9:20 (post-flood)

**Generic categories in Genesis:**
- Grass/vegetation (deshe')
- Seed-bearing herbs/plants ('eseb mazria zera)
- Fruit trees ('etz pri)
- Tree of Life
- Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil
- "Herb of the field" ('eseb hassadeh)
- "Fruit of the ground" (peri ha-adamah)
- "Green herbs" (yerek 'eseb)

**Plants specified in Midrashic sources:**
- Flaxseed/linen (Cain's offering - Midrash Tanchuma Bereishit 9)
- Wheat (Tree of Knowledge candidate - Genesis Rabbah 15:7)
- Grapes/vine (Tree of Knowledge candidate - Genesis Rabbah 15:7)
- Figs (Tree of Knowledge candidate - Genesis Rabbah 15:7)
- Etrog/citron (Tree of Knowledge candidate - Genesis Rabbah 15:7)
- Olive (connected to Garden via Noah's dove - Genesis Rabbah)

**Plants in Book of Jubilees:**
- Frankincense (Adam's offering - Jubilees 3:27)
- Galbanum (Adam's offering - Jubilees 3:27)
- Stacte (Adam's offering - Jubilees 3:27)
- Spices (unspecified - Jubilees 3:27)

**Notably absent from all antediluvian texts:**
- Dates/date palms - never mentioned
- Barley - not named for this period
- Reeds - no textual evidence
- Vegetables (cucumbers, onions, garlic, etc.) - none specified
- Legumes beyond flax - no mentions
- Specific herbs or spices by name (except in Jubilees' aromatic offerings)

## Distinguishing text from assumption

The gap between textual evidence and scholarly assumptions becomes clear when examining specific crops. **No Jewish text covering the antediluvian period mentions dates or date palms**, despite their agricultural importance in ancient Mesopotamia. Dates appear extensively in later biblical texts and rabbinic literature but remain absent from Creation-through-flood narratives. Archaeological evidence confirms date cultivation in ancient Mesopotamia, but this represents what likely existed historically, not what the texts claim existed.

Similarly, **wheat appears only as a rabbinic opinion about the Tree of Knowledge (Genesis Rabbah 15:7), not as an attested antediluvian crop**. Rabbi Meir's theory connects wheat to knowledge acquisition, but this represents interpretive speculation about Genesis 2-3, not a statement that Adam's family cultivated wheat fields. The text's "herb of the field" and "fruit of the ground" terminology remains generic.

**Barley never appears in antediluvian contexts** in any searched Jewish sources. While barley features prominently in later biblical agriculture (Exodus 9:31 mentions it in the plague narrative), no Genesis passage, Midrash, Talmud section, or Jubilees chapter names barley for the Creation-to-flood period. This silence is striking given barley's status as one of humanity's earliest domesticated grains.

The single most specific botanical identification comes from Midrash Tanchuma's statement about Cain's flaxseed offering—making flax the only crop explicitly named for antediluvian agriculture beyond the Tree of Knowledge debate. Fig and olive trees receive explicit mention in Genesis itself (figs for leaves, olives via the flood dove), giving them stronger textual foundation than any proposed grain, vegetable, or other fruit species.

## Conclusion: theological focus over botanical catalog

Jewish religious texts covering the antediluvian period prioritize theological and moral lessons over agricultural inventory. Genesis establishes functional plant categories (seed-bearing herbs, fruit trees, thorns and thistles) and names only a handful of specific species: figs for Adam's covering, olives signaling flood's end, and vineyards after Noah's emergence. Rabbinic literature adds meaningful details—flaxseed for Cain's inferior offering, four candidates for the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Life's cosmic scale—but still provides remarkably limited botanical specificity.

The texts emphasize agricultural struggle and divine-human relationship more than crop cataloging. Genesis 3's curse focuses on toil, sweat, and cursed ground producing thorns. Genesis 4 contrasts Cain's rejected "fruit of the ground" with Abel's accepted animal offering without taxonomic precision. The 1,656-year antediluvian period spanning ten generations receives minimal agricultural description beyond establishing that humans cultivated plants, ate seed-bearing herbs and tree fruits, and struggled with thorny weeds.

When Jewish sources do provide botanical specifics—Rabbi Meir naming wheat, Midrash Tanchuma identifying flaxseed, Jubilees listing frankincense and galbanum—these serve narrative, legal, or symbolic purposes rather than historical documentation. The wheat theory explains knowledge acquisition, the flaxseed tradition emphasizes Cain's inferior offering quality, and Jubilees' aromatics establish sacrificial precedent. Each botanical detail carries theological weight.

The absence of dates, barley, reeds, and specific vegetables from antediluvian texts, despite their importance in ancient Near Eastern agriculture and later biblical periods, reveals these sources' genre and purpose. They are theological narratives establishing creation order, human sinfulness, divine judgment, and covenant relationship—not agricultural treatises cataloging Mesopotamian crops. Recognizing this distinction prevents projecting archaeological knowledge onto texts that intentionally maintain botanical ambiguity while addressing weightier spiritual concerns.
