An immortal witness to the San Fernando Valley during 1900-1945 would have experienced one of the most dramatic transformations in American history—a sweeping metamorphosis from vast wheat fields and cattle ranches into a manufacturing powerhouse. The arrival of water in **November 1913** fundamentally altered everything, triggering mass annexations, explosive population growth from roughly 20,000 to over 228,000, and the rise of both Hollywood's dream factories and wartime aircraft plants. This period saw natural catastrophes reshape the landscape (the **1938 flood killed 113-115 people**, the **1933 Long Beach earthquake claimed 120 lives**), political machinations that became legendary (immortalized in "Chinatown"), and wartime mobilization that employed over 90,000 at Lockheed alone. For an immortal character, this era represents the foundational pivot from agricultural frontier to suburban-industrial complex—a transformation compressed into just 45 years that would define Southern California's future for the next century.

## The drought years and the dream of water (1900-1913)

**1900-1905: The agricultural frontier**

At the turn of the century, an immortal would have surveyed a sparsely populated agricultural empire of approximately 20,000 souls scattered across the Valley floor. The dominant crop was **wheat**—the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company controlled vast acreage, making the region one of the world's largest wheat-growing operations. Cattle ranching and sheep raising supplemented grain production, though the devastating drought of 1862-63 had long since ended the era of great cattle baronies. Four small towns served as market centers: **San Fernando (founded 1874), Burbank, Van Nuys, and Lankershim (later North Hollywood)**. Land sold for $5-$40 per acre, constrained by unreliable water supplies that limited profitability.

The Southern Pacific Railroad had opened its tunnel through San Fernando Pass in 1876, with a branch line to Chatsworth Park by 1895. An immortal traveler could ride these rails through golden grain fields that stretched to the horizon, interrupted only by scattered fruit and nut orchards planted near the Pacoima River where the water table ran high. The agricultural methods were predominantly dry farming—wheat and barley that depended on seasonal rainfall rather than irrigation.

**1902-1905: The conspiracy takes shape**

In 1902, Los Angeles purchased the Los Angeles City Water Company for $2 million, beginning the city's municipal water control. That same year, the U.S. Reclamation Act authorized federal irrigation projects, with the Owens Valley initially targeted for a 185,000-acre reclamation project. But powerful forces in Los Angeles—William Mulholland (chief engineer of the LA water system), Fred Eaton (former mayor and engineer), and J.B. Lippincott (Bureau of Reclamation regional engineer)—conspired to redirect Owens Valley water to Los Angeles instead.

By 1904, the LA Board of Water Commissioners authorized Mulholland to seek new water sources. **On July 29, 1905**, the city publicly announced plans to bring water from the Owens Valley, 233 miles away. The federal reclamation project was abandoned. An immortal with political connections would have sensed the machinations: city agents posing as ranchers and farmers to acquire Owens Valley land and water rights, creating false urgency about water shortages to secure public support.

**1906-1909: The San Fernando Syndicate**

Three eminent civil engineers verified Mulholland's audacious plan in 1906. In 1907, voters approved a **$23 million bond issue** for aqueduct construction, and design plans were completed. Construction began in earnest in **1908**, employing between 3,900 and 6,060 laborers at peak periods to build what would become the longest aqueduct in the world.

Meanwhile, a syndicate of Los Angeles's most powerful men—the "San Fernando Syndicate"—made their move. In **September 1909**, the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company acquired **47,500 acres of southern San Fernando Valley for $2.5 million** in what newspapers called "the biggest land transaction ever recorded in Los Angeles County." The syndicate members included **Harry Chandler** (business manager of the LA Times), **Harrison Gray Otis** (LA Times owner and Chandler's father-in-law), **H.J. Whitley** (real estate developer), **Moses Sherman** (Pacific Electric Railway investor), **Isaac Newton Van Nuys**, and **James Boon Lankershim** (heirs to the original ranching fortune).

An immortal character would have recognized the implications immediately: these men had advance knowledge of the aqueduct route and understood that water would transform worthless desert into agricultural gold. The property comprised everything west of Lankershim town limits and south of Roscoe Boulevard, excepting only Rancho Encino. The investment would prove spectacularly profitable, though accusations of corruption and "diabolical cabal" would haunt the syndicate's reputation—eventually dramatized in the 1974 film "Chinatown."

**1910-1913: "Sale of the Century" and railway arrival**

In **November 1910**, the Lankershim Farming and Milling Company held the "Sale of the Century"—a massive auction of livestock and non-land assets at Kester Ranch. The LA Times proclaimed it "the beginning of a new empire and a new era in the Southland." That same month, Tract 1000's subdivision map was filed with Los Angeles County, platting the future communities of Van Nuys, Marion (later Reseda), and Owensmouth (later Canoga Park).

The Pacific Electric Railway—the famous "Red Cars"—began extending into the Valley in late 1910. **On December 16, 1911**, the first car reached Van Nuys, celebrated as a transformative moment connecting the isolated Valley to Los Angeles employment and markets. The line extended to **Owensmouth on December 7, 1912**, and reached **San Fernando on March 22, 1913**. An immortal riding these trolleys would have watched grain fields being surveyed and subdivided into building lots, with the railway making commuting viable for the first time.

**February 22, 1911** marked the official opening of Van Nuys lot sales. William P. Whitsett, who purchased a half-interest in the Van Nuys townsite and became known as the "Father of Van Nuys," telephoned every person with a phone line in the LA area to invite them to the opening day barbecue. The syndicate staged construction of sidewalks, wells, and homes to attract buyers, offering $350 houses on installment plans.

In **1911**, both Burbank and San Fernando incorporated as independent cities—a decision that would prove significant when water politics forced most Valley communities into Los Angeles. That same year, Carl Laemmle began using Providencia Ranch (Oak Crest Ranch) for motion picture production, the first version of what would become Universal City.

By **November 5, 1913**, the monumental construction project was complete. An immortal among the 30,000-40,000 people gathered at the Cascades near the intersection of Foothill and Balboa Boulevards would have witnessed William Mulholland's terse, famous dedication: **"There it is, take it!"** Water from the Owens Valley, carried 233 miles through tunnels, conduits, and siphons, poured into the San Fernando Valley. The transformation had begun.

## Water unleashed: Annexation and the subdivision boom (1913-1929)

**1913-1915: Agricultural transformation and the water trap**

The arrival of aqueduct water in November 1913 triggered an immediate agricultural revolution. An immortal farmer would have watched the Valley shift from dry crops (wheat and barley) to profitable irrigated agriculture: **citrus groves** (oranges and lemons where land values reached $5,000 per acre—eight times other farmland), extensive **olive orchards** (the Sylmar grove became the world's largest at 2,000 acres, producing 50,000 gallons of olive oil and 200,000 gallons of ripe olives annually), **deciduous fruits** (apricots, peaches, persimmons), **walnuts**, and diverse field crops including corn, beans, cotton, alfalfa, and vegetables of every description.

But there was a catch—a trap built into the aqueduct's enabling legislation. Federal law prohibited Los Angeles from selling water outside city limits. Valley communities faced a stark choice: annex to Los Angeles or remain waterless. An immortal civic leader would have participated in heated town meetings where farmers and homeowners debated surrendering independence versus gaining agricultural prosperity.

**On March 29, 1915**, the main San Fernando Valley annexation occurred with an overwhelming vote of **681 to 25**. This single vote added **108,732 acres (approximately 170 square miles)** to Los Angeles, more than doubling the city's size. The annexation excluded Rancho El Escorpión, Owensmouth, Lankershim, Burbank, and San Fernando, covering most of the southern Valley (everything south of roughly Roscoe Boulevard). Burbank and San Fernando remained independent because they possessed their own water supplies from wells and the Sylmar Basin aquifers.

The annexations continued: **Van Nuys on May 22, 1915**; **Owensmouth (Canoga Park) on February 26, 1917** when its population of only 200 realized independent survival was impossible; **West Lankershim in 1919**; **Chatsworth in 1920**; and **Lankershim (North Hollywood) in 1923**. An immortal would remember the promises made during annexation campaigns—water for all, municipal services, connection to the great city—and the bitter reality when Lankershim residents found water delivery initially withheld, leading to foreclosures for many ranchers.

**1915-1920: Motion pictures and the First World War**

On **March 15, 1915**, Carl Laemmle officially opened Universal City on 230 acres of the Taylor Ranch property along Lankershim Boulevard—the world's first "city" dedicated entirely to motion pictures. Opening day attracted 10,000-20,000 visitors who could tour the facility and watch filmmaking in progress. Universal chose the Valley for inexpensive land ($165,000 for 230 acres), abundant space for outdoor filming, reliable sunshine, and diverse natural settings perfect for Westerns and adventure films.

An immortal working in early Hollywood would have understood why studios migrated north: the Valley offered 25-50% cheaper wages than East Coast production, room for massive backlots, and unincorporated areas with fewer regulations and lower taxes. The film industry would become the Valley's **third-largest industry by 1930**, after ranching and real estate development.

On **March 18, 1917**, the San Francisquito Power Plant No. 1 began operation—the first publicly owned commercial powerhouse, located in a mountain canyon approximately 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles along the aqueduct. Chief Electrical Engineer Ezra F. Scattergood, known as the "father of municipal power" in Los Angeles, oversaw the hydroelectric plants that sent electricity to downtown and gradually expanded service to Valley communities throughout the 1910s and 1920s.

World War I (1917-1918) touched the Valley lightly compared to the conflicts to come, but an immortal would have noticed young men departing for the trenches and the first stirrings of aircraft manufacturing interest in Southern California's year-round flying weather.

**1920-1929: The Roaring Twenties and explosive growth**

The 1920 census revealed the Valley's modest population: **just over 21,000 people total**, with San Fernando the largest community at 3,204 residents, followed by Burbank at 2,913. But the decade would bring explosive transformation.

On **January 17, 1920**, the 18th Amendment took effect, beginning Prohibition. An immortal wine merchant or restaurant owner would have faced devastating choices. California's 700+ wineries shrank to 380 by 1933. In the Valley and throughout Los Angeles, only religious wine production survived legally—San Antonio Winery in Lincoln Heights made sacramental wine, while Mission San Fernando produced altar wine for Holy Communion. Underground, an estimated 30,000 illegal speakeasies operated by 1927 (twice the number of pre-Prohibition legal bars), with crime syndicates led by figures like Charles Crawford controlling distribution. Rural Valley canyons provided cover for hidden stills and moonshine operations.

The 1920s brought unprecedented real estate speculation and population growth. The Valley became a land promoter's paradise, marketed as an agricultural gem with Mediterranean climate. Free excursions, barbecues, and automobile races drew prospective buyers. An immortal real estate agent would have watched land values double and redouble as irrigation systems installed between 1915-1917 enabled unprecedented crop variety. **Sherman Way**, the 22-mile paved highway built by the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company for $500,000, connected Van Nuys, Reseda, and Owensmouth with a divided roadway featuring Pacific Electric tracks down the center—said to have inspired the county's first bond issue for paved roads.

The motion picture industry expanded rapidly in the Valley's southeast during 1915-1930, attracted by cheap land, sunny weather, and varied filming locations. In **May 1928**, Mack Sennett opened his new studio on 20 acres at Ventura Boulevard and Radford Avenue (Studio City), relocating from Echo Park after years of producing Keystone Cops comedies and launching Charlie Chaplin's career.

In **1926**, First National Pictures built a 62-acre studio lot in Burbank that would become Warner Bros.-First National Pictures headquarters after the Warner brothers purchased majority interest in September 1928, flush with profits from the revolutionary "talkie" film "The Jazz Singer." By 1929, the studio produced 86 features, adding nine new soundstages in 1930.

By decade's end, the Valley's character was established: agricultural production (citrus, olives, field crops, dairy, poultry) dominated the central and western areas, while the southeast increasingly showed signs of suburbanization. The population reached approximately **78,479 by 1930**—a nearly fourfold increase in just a decade. An immortal witness would have seen family farms, citrus groves extending to the horizon, packing houses shipping 500 rail cars of produce annually from San Fernando alone, and the first wave of suburban housing creeping westward from Cahuenga Pass.

## Disasters and Depression: Testing the Valley's resilience (1928-1940)

**1928: Catastrophe in the canyon**

Just before midnight on **March 12, 1928**, the St. Francis Dam—built 1924-1926 to store over 12 billion gallons of aqueduct water—catastrophically failed. Though located north of the Valley in San Francisquito Canyon, the disaster's psychological impact reverberated throughout the region. The dam collapse sent a 140-foot wall of water down the canyon at 18 mph, killing **at least 431-450 people** (exact numbers were never determined) and devastating communities including Castaic, Piru, Fillmore, Santa Paula, and Saticoy before reaching the Pacific Ocean.

An immortal attending the coroner's inquest would have watched William Mulholland—the visionary who brought water to Los Angeles and made the Valley's transformation possible—take full responsibility and resign in disgrace. The disaster exposed discrimination in relief efforts against Mexican and Japanese migrant workers, halted the rapid pace of Valley annexations, and led to formation of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California for more diverse water sourcing. It stands as one of the worst American civil engineering disasters of the 20th century.

That same year, metropolitan development accelerated. On **December 17, 1928**, Metropolitan Airport opened in Van Nuys—the Valley's first major airport. By 1928, the Cahuenga Pass Road was considered "the most heavily traveled highway in the world," as automobile ownership transformed Valley settlement patterns. Distance from downtown Los Angeles became less of a barrier as cars enabled dispersed suburban development that would have been impossible in the railway era.

**1929-1933: The Great Depression arrives**

The stock market crash of October 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression struck the Valley hard, though not as devastatingly as industrial cities. An immortal farmer would have watched agricultural prices collapse while maintaining production. The Valley's 1930 economy remained "overwhelmingly agricultural," with **58,359 acres in rotating crops**—the agricultural peak before decline. Field crops (alfalfa, beans, vegetables) dominated the central and western Valley, citrus concentrated on frost-free ground in the north and northeast (typically 10-15 acre owner-operated groves), olives north of San Fernando, deciduous fruit and walnuts scattered across the valley floor, and poultry and dairy farming concentrated in the west.

Despite economic hardship, population continued growing to **155,443 by 1940**—approximately 77,000 more residents than 1930. Remarkably, **56% of the Valley's 1940 housing stock was constructed during the Depression decade**, as improved highways and automobile use enabled continued suburban settlement even amid unemployment and financial crisis.

An immortal social worker would have witnessed the human cost: Los Angeles PTAs sought donations of eggs, fruits, and vegetables to feed hungry children in 1931; food pantries opened; 600 jobless men were hired for San Francisquito Canyon tunnel work to increase water flow; by 1934, civilians on welfare replaced police officers as school crossing guards. Communist Party activity increased, leading to arrests and deportations.

The **1933 Long Beach earthquake** struck on **March 10, 1933, at 5:54 PM PST** with magnitude 6.4, killing **115-120 people** and causing $40 million in damage (nearly $1 billion in 2024 dollars). Though centered offshore near Huntington Beach, shaking was felt throughout the San Fernando Valley. An immortal schoolteacher would remember the aftermath most clearly: 230+ school buildings destroyed or damaged, leading to passage of the **Field Act** just 30 days later, establishing earthquake-resistant design standards for public schools. The Riley Act followed, requiring cities and counties to regulate building construction—California's first statewide seismic building codes.

On **December 5, 1933**, the 21st Amendment repealed Prohibition. An immortal proprietor could finally operate a legal bar or restaurant serving alcohol after 13 years of underground economy. Of California's pre-Prohibition 700 wineries, only 380 remained to resume legal production.

**1935-1938: Recovery, migration, and catastrophic flood**

In **1935**, Republic Pictures formed through merger of Mascot Pictures, Monogram Pictures, and Consolidated Film Corporation, taking over the former Mack Sennett Studios site in Studio City. Republic specialized in B-movies, Westerns, and serials, launching the careers of John Wayne, Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers. An immortal filmgoer would have spent many Saturday afternoons watching Republic serials.

The Dust Bowl migration began bringing displaced farmers—"Okies"—to California in search of work. Dorothea Lange photographed Oklahoma refugees arriving in San Fernando in overloaded vehicles throughout the mid-1930s. More migrants settled in the Los Angeles area than in the San Joaquin Valley, seeking agricultural work in the still-productive Valley farms.

**February 27-March 3, 1938** brought the Valley's worst natural disaster of the era. The catastrophic Los Angeles flood began with 4.4 inches of rainfall February 27-March 1, followed by an additional 10 inches in lowlands and 32 inches in the mountains by March 3. Downtown LA recorded 5.88 inches on March 2 alone—the wettest single day. The five-day total reached 11.06 inches.

An immortal resident of Van Nuys would have fled rising waters as **108,000 acres flooded in Los Angeles County**, with the San Fernando Valley the worst affected area. Tujunga Wash peaked at 54,000 cubic feet per second on March 3, with Upper Big Tujunga Canyon "swept clean" of any structures not above the flood line. Pacoima Wash inundated Van Nuys. At Universal City, the Lankershim Boulevard bridge collapsed, killing five people. The catastrophic flood killed **113-115 people total** and destroyed 5,601 buildings while damaging 1,500 more, causing **$78 million in damage** ($1.74 billion in 2024 dollars).

An immortal survivor would have understood the bitter irony: communities built during the 1920s boom occupied low-lying former agricultural areas—flood plains that had been safe for farming but deadly for residential development. The disaster prompted massive flood control investments: Hansen Dam was completed in 1940 (construction had begun pre-flood but was incomplete), Sepulveda Dam was built in 1941 to protect the lower Valley, Burbank, and Glendale, and the Flood Control Act of 1941 authorized channelizing the Los Angeles River in concrete—a 20-year project that would encase 278 miles of streams.

**1938-1940: Mobilization begins**

By the late 1930s, aircraft manufacturing—particularly Lockheed in Burbank—was attracting workers and stimulating economic recovery. Lockheed had relocated to Burbank in March 1928 and throughout the 1930s built Vega transports and Hudson bombers, becoming the Valley's primary industrial employer. By 1940, Valley population reached **155,443**, with urban nuclei in the southeast beginning to coalesce.

On **June 1, 1938**, the Pacific Electric Railway terminated service beyond Van Nuys to Owensmouth and San Fernando due to flood-damaged bridges and declining ridership. An immortal who had ridden the first trolley to Van Nuys on December 16, 1911, would have mourned the end of an era, understanding that the automobile had decisively triumphed.

In **1940**, the Arroyo Seco Parkway opened from Los Angeles to Pasadena—the region's first limited-access freeway, handling 33,000 cars daily by 1941 and demonstrating the future of transportation. That same year, Lockheed purchased Burbank Airport (renaming it Lockheed Air Terminal), and Walt Disney Studios officially opened its purpose-built animation facility on 51 acres at 500 South Buena Vista Street in Burbank after moving from Silver Lake. The Disney facility, designed by architect Kem Weber, was financed by the enormous success of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937).

As 1940 closed, the Valley stood poised between its agricultural past and industrial-suburban future, with approximately 112,000 residents, thousands of acres still in citrus and field crops, but with aircraft plants expanding and housing subdivisions pushing westward along improved highways. War in Europe suggested where the future lay.

## Arsenal of democracy: World War II transformation (1940-1945)

**1940-1941: Defense mobilization**

An immortal worker at Lockheed would have witnessed the company's explosive transformation from 2,300 pre-war employees building commercial transports and export bombers to war production on an unprecedented scale. The company's Burbank plants (designated Plant B-1 for P-38 Lightning fighters, Plant A-1 for B-17 Flying Fortress bombers built under Boeing license, and the secret Plant B-6 that would later house the famous "Skunk Works") began expanding rapidly.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on **December 7, 1941** accelerated everything. An immortal could watch Lockheed employment surge toward an eventual peak of **over 90,000 workers**—a 39-fold increase from pre-war levels. The company produced aircraft around the clock in shifts. Women entered the workforce in unprecedented numbers, comprising 40% of employees at some plants, working as welders, assemblers, and designers in jobs previously reserved for men.

Lockheed's entire facility was camouflaged with an enormous burlap tarp creating a fake suburban landscape with painted homes, streets, trees, and fire hydrants—Disney set designers assisted in the deception to protect the plant from potential Japanese air raids. An immortal walking beneath this false sky would have experienced one of the war's most surreal environments.

Metropolitan Airport in Van Nuys was converted to **Van Nuys Army Air Field**, serving as a training and military operations base. Birmingham General Hospital was established as a military medical facility. Throughout the Valley, civilian auxiliary police forces, bomb squads, firefighting brigades, and evacuation teams organized.

**1942-1943: Wartime society**

**Executive Order 9066**, signed by President Roosevelt in 1942, ordered the internment of Japanese Americans, including Valley farmers and residents who were removed to camps. An immortal Japanese-American farmer would have lost everything—land, crops, equipment, home—forced into detention while women and teenage boys took over abandoned farming operations.

The Valley's social fabric transformed completely. Defense work dominated employment. Women maintained not just farms but also took skilled manufacturing positions. The motion picture industry, already the Valley's third-largest by 1930, continued production but with many male stars and crew serving in the military.

In 1943, 4,133 lots were approved for war housing subdivisions. The Lockheed **Skunk Works** was founded that year under Clarence "Kelly" Johnson's leadership—the secret facility that would later design the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117 stealth fighter. Vega Aircraft, which Lockheed had spun off in 1936, merged back into the parent company to consolidate wartime production.

**1943-1945: The arsenal roars**

From **July 1, 1940 through August 31, 1945**, Lockheed produced **19,278 aircraft**—approximately 6% of total U.S. aircraft production, making it the nation's fifth-largest aircraft manufacturer. The total included P-38 Lightning fighters, Hudson bombers, and 2,750 B-17 Flying Fortress bombers built under Boeing license. An immortal assembly worker would have sent thousands of aircraft to combat theaters in Europe and the Pacific, knowing that P-38s shot down more Japanese aircraft than any other Allied fighter.

Van Nuys hosted additional defense activity: General Motors assembly plants produced M-5 Light Tanks at 500 per month, while Timm Aircraft manufactured 262 military aircraft. By war's end, **60-70% of American aerospace industry was located in Southern California**, with the San Fernando Valley at its heart.

The Valley's population exploded from approximately 112,000 in 1940 to **175,000+ by 1945**—a **56% increase during war years**. An immortal landlord would have watched every available housing unit fill with defense workers arriving from across the nation. The western Valley remained agricultural during the war, devoted to field crops with scattered citrus and olive orchards, but the southeast urbanization was complete—only truck gardens and occasional orchards remained operational.

The Valley employment increased from approximately 29,000 in 1940 to roughly 120,000 by 1950 (though 1945 figures fell somewhere between as wartime employment peaked then declined slightly with war's end and reconversion). Aircraft manufacturing, which had been a small sector in the 1930s, utterly dominated the wartime economy.

**1945: Victory and the suburban future**

By war's end in August 1945, the San Fernando Valley had been fundamentally transformed. An immortal who had witnessed the wheat fields of 1900, the water arrival in 1913, the subdivision boom of the 1920s, and the wartime mobilization would recognize that the Valley's future was written: suburban residential development fed by aerospace manufacturing, connected by freeways, spreading westward across former farmland.

The Valley's population of **228,734 in 1945** would double to over 400,000 by the late 1940s and continue growing through the 1950s and beyond. The agricultural era was ending—though an immortal farmer in the western Valley might still harvest citrus and olives for a few more years before the subdivisions arrived. The motion picture industry remained strong, with Universal, Warner Bros., Republic, and Disney all producing films and cartoons. The aerospace industry dominated, with Lockheed and other manufacturers transitioning from wartime production to commercial aircraft and defense contracts in the emerging Cold War.

## Cultural institutions: Churches, schools, theaters

An immortal's spiritual and cultural life during 1900-1945 would have been shaped by expanding institutions serving growing communities.

**Religious institutions and text availability**

Mission San Fernando Rey de España, founded in 1797, became a working church again when Oblate priests arrived in 1920/1923, bringing Catholic liturgical materials, Latin Vulgate Bibles, vernacular translations, missals, catechisms, and devotional literature. **St. Ferdinand Parish**, founded in 1902 by Bishop George Montgomery, covered the entire San Fernando Valley as a single Catholic parish, establishing infrastructure for distributing religious texts. As population grew, additional parishes formed: **St. Charles Borromeo in North Hollywood (1920)** and **Our Lady of the Valley in Canoga Park (1921)**, when most of its 620 parishioners were involved in agriculture.

Protestant churches brought King James and other Bible translations, hymnals, Sunday School materials, and denominational literature. Notable Protestant congregations included **Chatsworth Community Church (1903)**, **Burbank Foursquare Church (1927)**, **Mount Zion Baptist Church of Burbank (1940)**, and **First Baptist Church of Reseda (1942)**. Churches often shared or distributed Bibles to community members.

The Valley's Jewish community remained small until the late 1930s. **Adat Ari El** was founded in 1938 by fifteen couples as the first Conservative synagogue in the San Fernando Valley, originally meeting in temporary locations including a former speakeasy on Chandler Boulevard before moving to a permanent location near Burbank and Laurel Canyon in 1949. The synagogue brought Torah scrolls, Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Talmuds, prayer books (siddurim), High Holy Day prayer books (machzorim), and established Hebrew school with educational texts. **Temple Beth Hillel**, a Reform congregation, was founded in 1946. By 1946, these were the only two organized Jewish institutions in the Valley; only 9% of Los Angeles Jews lived in the Valley in 1953.

**Schools**

The Valley's first public school operated in the 1880s where Van Norman Reservoir now stands. **San Fernando Union High School** was established in 1896 at Fifth and Hagar streets in the City of San Fernando, moving to North Brand Boulevard in 1906. It became one of the oldest high schools in Los Angeles Unified School District. As population grew during the 1920s-1940s, schools multiplied across the Valley, though comprehensive founding dates for elementary and secondary schools during this period are scattered across community records.

**Theaters**

For entertainment beyond church socials and school events, an immortal would have attended several significant regional theaters. The **Cody Theater in San Fernando** opened in June 1924, equipped with a Wurlitzer pipe organ and designed by architect A. Godfrey Bailey. It was renamed San Fernando Theatre in 1935 and served as one of the Valley's first major theaters until severe damage in the 1971 Sylmar Earthquake led to demolition. The **Glen Theatre in Glendale** (also known as Bard's Theatre) opened in 1925 with 844 seats, designed by architect Kenneth Gordon—a significant theater in the eastern Valley that operated until the 1960s.

The automobile age brought a new entertainment form: the **San-Val Theatre Drive-In** opened in Burbank on **June 10, 1938**, at San Fernando Road and Winona Street, becoming the second drive-in facility in the West. An immortal on that opening night would have experienced the novelty of watching movies from the privacy and comfort of one's automobile—a quintessentially Californian entertainment form perfectly suited to the Valley's car-oriented culture.

## Infrastructure backbone: Power, transportation, flood control

An immortal engineer or public works official would have watched the Valley's infrastructure transform from primitive to modern during 1900-1945.

**Electric power** arrived gradually: hydroelectric plants along the aqueduct (Division Creek and Cottonwood built 1908-1913) and San Francisquito Power Plant No. 1 (1917) sent electricity to Los Angeles. The San Fernando Power Plant was built at the Cascades where the aqueduct descends into the LA basin. Southern California Edison acquired Pacific Light and Power in 1917, gradually extending electric service to Valley communities throughout the 1910s-1920s—Owensmouth didn't receive electricity until after 1913.

**Flood control infrastructure** responded to disasters: after the destructive 1914 flood caused $10 million in damage and led to formation of the County Flood Control District, and especially after the catastrophic 1938 flood, Hansen Dam (completed 1940) and Sepulveda Dam (1941) were constructed to protect Valley communities. The Los Angeles River channelization authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1941 would eventually encase 278 miles of streams in concrete over a 20-year period.

**Roads and highways** evolved from dirt wagon tracks to modern paved highways: Sherman Way (built ~1910-1911 for $500,000), improvements to Cahuenga Pass Road through the 1920s (becoming "most heavily traveled highway in world" by 1928), the Arroyo Seco Parkway (1940), and planning for future freeway systems that would be built in the post-war era.

## External forces: Panama Canal, Prohibition, and the Great Depression

An immortal tracking global events would have understood how external forces shaped Valley development. The **Panama Canal**, opening August 15, 1914, supercharged West Coast growth by cutting distance from San Francisco to New York from 13,000+ miles to ~5,000 miles. Studies suggest the Canal increased California's market access enough to boost population 6% by 1940 and raised America's national income 4% higher than without it. The Canal made Los Angeles viable as a major economic hub, facilitating oil exports from the West Coast, lumber transport, manufacturing growth, and immigration—directly benefiting Valley development.

**National Prohibition (January 17, 1920 - December 5, 1933)** devastated California's wine industry, closed legal bars, and created underground criminal networks. Valley residents drank in speakeasies, bought from bootleggers, or produced their own wine legally (200 gallons "non-intoxicating cider and fruit juice" annually for home use). Rural canyons hosted moonshine operations. Crime syndicates controlled illegal distribution with protection from corrupt officials. When Prohibition ended in 1933, only 380 of California's pre-Prohibition 700 wineries remained.

The **Great Depression (1929-1939)** brought unemployment, food insecurity, relief camps, and economic hardship but didn't halt Valley growth. Population increased from approximately 78,000 (1930) to 155,000 (1940), with 56% of 1940 housing built during the Depression decade—a testament to cheap land, automobile access, and continued migration despite economic crisis.

## The immortal's retrospective

An immortal witness surveying the San Fernando Valley in late 1945 would reflect on 45 years of breathtaking transformation. The wheat fields and cattle ranches of 1900, supporting roughly 20,000 people living in scattered farm towns, had become a sprawling metropolitan region of nearly 230,000 people, with vast aircraft plants employing tens of thousands, film studios producing global entertainment, subdivisions spreading across former farmland, and infrastructure (water, power, flood control, transportation) supporting continued explosive growth.

The character would remember walking bone-dry arroyos in 1910, then watching Mulholland's triumphant water arrival in November 1913. They would recall voting in the March 29, 1915 annexation (681 to 25) that surrendered local autonomy for access to water—the defining political trade-off of Valley history. They would have witnessed real estate speculation by the San Fernando Syndicate, the Pacific Electric Red Cars arriving (first to Van Nuys on December 16, 1911), Carl Laemmle opening Universal City (March 15, 1915), the Roaring Twenties subdivision boom, Prohibition's underground economy, the Stock Market Crash, and the Depression's hardships.

Natural disasters would feature prominently in memory: the St. Francis Dam collapse (March 12, 1928) killing 431-450 people and destroying Mulholland's reputation; the Long Beach earthquake (March 10, 1933) killing 115-120 and leading to California's first seismic building codes; and especially the catastrophic 1938 flood (February 27-March 3) that killed 113-115, destroyed thousands of buildings, and demonstrated that 1920s development had unwisely built homes in flood plains.

They would remember Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) and the total mobilization that followed—Lockheed's workforce exploding from 2,300 to over 90,000, the entire facility camouflaged under fake suburbia, women welding P-38 Lightning fighters, Japanese-American neighbors removed to internment camps, and the steady stream of 19,278 aircraft leaving Burbank plants for war zones. They would recall the Valley's population surging 56% during war years, defense workers flooding in from across America, and agriculture beginning its final retreat before tract housing.

For an immortal character, this 45-year period represents perhaps the most compressed, dramatic transformation they witnessed in any location. From agricultural frontier to aerospace manufacturing powerhouse, from 20,000 souls to 230,000, from wheat fields to Warner Bros, from horse-drawn wagons to freeways—all accomplished in less than half a century. The foundation was laid for the San Fernando Valley to become one of America's archetypal suburban landscapes, a symbol of both the California Dream and its contradictions. Every institution, infrastructure system, economic sector, and community pattern that would define the Valley through the rest of the 20th century was established during 1900-1945. An immortal would recognize these years as the Valley's founding era—the period when everything changed, forever.
