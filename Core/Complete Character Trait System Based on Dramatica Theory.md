## The 8 Archetypal Characters (Pure Combinations)

1. **PROTAGONIST** = Pursue + Consideration
2. **ANTAGONIST** = Prevent/Avoid + Reconsideration
3. **GUARDIAN** = Help + Conscience
4. **CONTAGONIST** = Hinder + Temptation
5. **REASON** = Control + Logic
6. **EMOTION** = Uncontrolled + Feeling
7. **SIDEKICK** = Support + Faith
8. **SKEPTIC** = Oppose + Disbelief

**Complex Characters** mix elements in non-archetypal ways, creating internal conflicts and more realistic personalities.

## Using This System

**For Character Development:**
- Which of the 64 elements does each character possess?
- Which are deliberately missing? (Missing traits = vulnerabilities or blind spots)
- Where do characters have non-archetypal combinations? (Creates internal conflict)
- Which dimensions are well-developed vs. underdeveloped?

**For Conflict Creation:**
- Characters with opposing elements in the same dimension will clash
- Characters missing complementary elements will frustrate each other
- Complex characters with internal contradictions face harder choices

**For Plot:**
- Which elements are needed to solve the story's central problem?
- Who has those elements?
- What happens when the person with the needed element is absent or oppositional?

**For Awan Specifically:**
You'll want to decide which elements she possesses, especially noting:
- Her analytical/logical traits vs. emotional responses
- Whether she's proactive or reactive
- What she evaluates by (process vs. results, actuality vs. perception)
- What she's ultimately trying to achieve (knowledge? change? equity?)

Then map how her elements compare/contrast with her family members to predict where friction and connection will naturally occur.
