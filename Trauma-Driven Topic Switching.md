## Overview

This document models how trauma and neurodivergence shape the associative movement of Samyaza's narration. It provides a framework for designing narrative flow that authentically represents a mind shaped by CPTSD.

## Two Types of Topic Switching

### Autistic Association
- Follows internally coherent logic that may not be obvious to listeners
- Triggered by: word meanings, sensory details, structural patterns between situations, sound-alike phrases
- The connection *exists*—it's just not the connection a neurotypical person would make
- Often leads toward special interests or pattern-recognition tangents

### Trauma-Driven Switching
Three distinct mechanisms:

1. **Avoidant**: Veering away from content approaching pain. Often mid-sentence, sometimes mid-word. The "anyway..." pivot.

2. **Intrusive**: Being *pulled toward* trauma content involuntarily. Not away—a sudden gravitational collapse toward the wound.

3. **Dissociative**: Losing the thread entirely. Coming back somewhere else without knowing how you got there.

**For someone with both autism and trauma, these layer and interweave. The reader (and sometimes Samyaza himself) may not know which kind of shift just happened.**

## Graph Structure for Narrative Design

### Node Types

| Type | Description | Examples for Samyaza |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Trauma Nodes** | The actual traumatic events/memories | The fall, the binding, the flood, watching the Nephilim die, God's judgment |
| **Neutral Nodes** | Regular topics, places, people, ideas | Grape cultivation, a specific mountain, human tool-making |
| **Safe Harbors** | Practiced escape destinations | See dedicated section below |

### Core Principle

> **Contamination flows backward.** Any node can collapse toward traumatic nodes.

The trauma nodes aren't the ones with outbound links. They have *gravity*. Neutral nodes have vectors pointing toward them based on shared attributes.

## Link Types and Weights

### Inbound Links to Trauma Nodes

Links are created when a neutral node shares attributes with a trauma node. Not all shared attributes carry equal weight:

#### Heaviest Weight: Core Wound Themes
- Abandonment
- Powerlessness / loss of agency
- Watching loved ones die
- Betrayal by trusted authority
- Being observed/judged

#### Heavy Weight: Sensory Details Present During Trauma
- Specific qualities of light
- Sounds (God's voice, screaming, water)
- Physical sensations (falling, binding, drowning)
- Smells, colors associated with traumatic events

#### Medium Weight: Structural/Pattern Similarities
- Power dynamics that rhyme with the traumatic relationship
- Situations involving judgment or punishment
- Parent-child dynamics (especially destruction of children)
- Authority figures demanding obedience

#### Lighter Weight (But Still Present)
- Wordplay and double meanings
- Random lexical overlaps
- Phonetic similarities

### Special Case: Wordplay as Trigger

Wordplay can trigger switching if:
1. The word's alternate meaning connects to traumatic content ("fall," "watch," "bind")
2. The abuser used wordplay (Hebrew texts are dense with this—if God spoke in puns, the *act* of noticing double meanings may itself be triggering)
3. The word was spoken during trauma (both meanings now contaminated)

### Escape Links

These point *away* from high-danger zones toward safe harbors. They activate when trauma proximity becomes too intense.

## Safe Harbor Destinations

When ricocheting away from trauma, the destination isn't random. These are the categories:

### 1. Practiced Safe Harbors
- Narratives told a thousand times
- Polished, performance-quality anecdotes
- The telling is soothing because it's *known*
- **Identifying feature**: Stories that feel rehearsed, memories he returns to repeatedly

### 2. Pre-Trauma Territory
- Temporally protected: the bad thing hadn't happened yet
- Memories uncontaminated by what came after
- **For Samyaza**: Early observations of humans, initial wonder, moments with other Watchers before the fall

### 3. Intellectualization Zones
- Abstract, analytical, cerebral content
- Escaping the body (where trauma lives) by going into the head
- Emotional temperature drops; he becomes a lecturer
- **For Samyaza**: Cosmology, linguistics, technical observations about human development, philosophy, comparative mythology

### 4. Other People's Stories
- Deflection: "But enough about me—let me tell you about Azazel"
- Focus shifts to someone else's narrative
- Still connected to the larger story, but he's no longer the subject
- **For Samyaza**: Azazel, Awan, specific humans he observed, other Watchers

### 5. Sensory Present
- Grounding in the immediate moment
- The room he's in *now*, the drink in his hand, the weather
- Actually healthy coping, but reads as sudden topic abandonment
- **For Samyaza**: The bar, the Valley, present-day observations

## Samyaza-Specific Trauma Signatures

These are the attributes to tag on his trauma nodes, which then create inbound links from any neutral node sharing them:

### Events
- The fall / falling
- The binding (chained to rocks/stars)
- The flood
- Death of the Nephilim
- God's judgment/voice
- Watching helplessly

### Sensory
- The quality of light during the fall
- Sound of water (flood)
- Physical sensation of binding/restraint
- Whatever God's presence felt like

### Thematic
- Abandonment by authority/creator
- Punishment for love/desire
- Loss of children
- Being forced to watch
- Powerlessness despite power
- Transgression of boundaries

### Relational
- The women (specific and collective)
- The children / Nephilim
- The other Watchers (especially those punished differently)
- God
- Humans generally (complicated—both beloved and source of his transgression)

## Narrative Applications

### Showing Trauma Without Narrating It
The architecture of Samyaza's language reveals the shape of what he can't say. Topic switches, especially abrupt ones, map the borders of his wounds.

### Attractor vs. Flashpoint Nodes
- **Attractors**: Hard to escape once you enter their gravity well. He might circle these, approaching and retreating.
- **Flashpoints**: Touch them and ricochet away immediately. Brief contact, maximum deflection.

### Reader Experience
The reader learns to read his avoidances. What he *won't* talk about becomes as significant as what he will. The pattern of his deflections tells its own story.
