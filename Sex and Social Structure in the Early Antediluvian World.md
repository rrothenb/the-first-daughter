## Core Premise

The early antediluvian world—particularly during Awan's first centuries—existed **before the conceptual frameworks** that would later shape human social organization. This wasn't an alternative system to patriarchy or property; it was a pre-systematic state where such structures were unnecessary and incoherent.

## Why Property Didn't Exist

Property rights solve problems that don't exist when:

- **Everyone is immediate family** - Who are you protecting resources from? Your brother? Your mother?
- **Lifespans are 900 years** - Inheritance is meaningless when you outlive your possessions and your parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents are all still alive
- **Population is tiny** - No strangers exist to trade with or exclude
- **No discrete generations** - The parent/child distinction blurs when generations overlap by centuries

Modern families don't have internal property relations—siblings share the refrigerator, children don't pay rent. The antediluvian world operated on family logic because it *was* one family.

## Why Patriarchy Couldn't Exist

Patriarchy requires:

1. **Paternity certainty** - Not established. Abel (the shepherd) died young before animal husbandry could reveal the sex-reproduction connection. The sheep weren't being bred for meat (pre-flood world was vegetarian per Genesis 1:29)—they just existed and reproduced on their own.

2. **Property to inherit through male line** - No property concept.

3. **Control of female sexuality** - No reason to control it. No inheritance stakes, no paternity concerns.

4. **Framework for sexual shame** - None existed. Shame requires something to be ashamed *of*.

## The Sex-Reproduction Connection

With 900-year lifespans and no systematic animal breeding:

- Sex was understood as pleasurable and somehow related to pregnancy
- But the specific connection (this act + this man = this child) likely remained unclear
- Nine months between cause and effect is a long time
- Many hunter-gatherer societies have fuzzy understanding of paternity even today
- **Maternal lineage was the only certain lineage**—you always know who the mother is

## What "Marriage" Actually Was

The Hebrew word **אִשָּׁה (ishah)** means both "woman" and "wife"—there's no distinction in the language. When Genesis says Cain "knew his ishah," it literally means "his woman." The translation as "wife" is interpretive.

In Awan's world:
- No ceremony, no contract, no status change
- "His woman / her man" was descriptive of current attachment, not institutional
- Relationships formed and dissolved based on mutual feeling
- No adultery concept (requires marriage and property)
- No one "belonged to" anyone else

---

## The Nature of Sex

### What It Wasn't
- **Not romantic/passionate** - No novelty, no mystery, no strangers to discover
- **Not scarce or competitive** - Everyone available, no one "taken"
- **Not high-stakes** - No consequences, no rejection to fear, no loss to risk
- **Not transgressive** - Nothing to transgress against

### What It Was
- Pleasant, friendly, bonding in a low-key way
- Mutual comfort and warmth
- More like "fuck buddies" or mutual masturbation
- Scratching an itch together
- Like a back rub or sharing food

### Why No Strong Attraction
- **No novelty** - You've known everyone for centuries
- **Westermarck damping** - Deep familiarity with everyone, even siblings born centuries apart
- **No urgency** - Nothing to compete for, no one to lose
- **No otherness** - True *eros* requires encountering an *other*

---

## Bisexuality as Default

With no reasons *not* to be bisexual:
- No religious prohibition
- No reproductive mandate (no heirs, no lineage)
- No rigid gender roles defining "appropriate" desire
- No shame framework
- No identity categories forcing "one thing or another"

Westermarck aversion (not gender) did most of the work shaping attraction—pushing people away from those raised closely together, regardless of sex.

---

## Childcare: Before "Alloparenting"

The term "alloparenting" implies an alternative to primary parenting. In Awan's world, that distinction doesn't exist.

- The village IS the family IS the village
- No distinction between "my child" and "our children"
- Not a philosophy or social arrangement—just tautological reality
- Everyone holds the babies because there's no "not-us"
- "It takes a village" is meaningless when the village is literally everyone you know

---

## Power and Authority

- Based on competence, experience, age—not gender or formal position
- Adam and Eve have authority as first and oldest
- Awan, as firstborn daughter present for centuries, has enormous informal influence
- But "authority" is just influence through persuasion, not command
- No enforcement mechanism for hierarchy

---

## The Watchers' Arrival: Why It Changed Everything

For the first time in human history:
- **Genuine others** - Unknown, novel, different
- **Someone you haven't known for centuries**
- **The possibility of being truly *seen***

"The sons of God saw the daughters of men were beautiful"—perhaps the first time anyone experienced attraction with *heat* to it. The first time novelty and otherness created the conditions for consuming desire.

Samyaza's feelings for Awan may be something neither of them has a framework for.

---

## Implications for the Narrative

### For Awan's Character
Her traits—communal, inquisitive, comfortable with sex and her body, free of shame, kind, generous—aren't anachronistic modern values projected backward. They're what organic morality looks like when the conditions that produce patriarchy, property-anxiety, and sexual shame don't exist.

### For Samyaza as Narrator
He faces the impossible task of describing a pre-systematic world using post-systematic language. Every word (wife, family, property, father) carries millennia of institutional overlay. Awan's exact words, preserved in his memory, may be one of the few places where the older way of thinking survives.

### The Tragedy
The world Awan lived in—the world she *was*—gets buried as population grows, surplus accumulates, strangers emerge, and the sex-reproduction connection becomes clearer. The apparatus of property-patriarchy-inheritance crystallizes. Then the flood erases even the memory. Then Genesis rewrites the origin to make patriarchal marriage seem primordial.
