## Temple Grandin's Typology: Useful but Not Canonical

Temple Grandin proposed three (later four) types of autistic thinking:
1. **Visual Thinkers** - photo-realistic mental imagery, good at design, poor at algebra
2. **Pattern Thinkers** - math/music minds, see abstract patterns, may struggle with composition
3. **Verbal Thinkers** - fact memory, good at languages/writing, poor at visual skills
4. **Auditory Thinkers** (added later)

**Status:** This is folk taxonomy based on Grandin's personal observations ("by questioning many people"), not peer-reviewed research. The DSM-5 moved away from autism subtypes entirely. Her "pattern thinking" largely rediscovers what intelligence researchers call "fluid intelligence." The categories are a useful provocation but not scientifically validated consensus.

**For Samyaza:** His profile doesn't fit neatly into these boxes. The INTP cognitive style (Ti-dominant, Ne-auxiliary) - treating language as a formal system, obsession with etymology and semantic precision, loving the architecture of meaning - is its own thing.

## What the Texts Actually Say

### The "Watcher" Name is External

- The term עירין (*iyrin* - "wakeful ones") comes from Daniel and 1 Enoch
- It's what the *texts* call them, not what they called themselves
- Genesis 6 just says "sons of God" (bene elohim)
- The name derives from the idea that angels don't sleep, not from any described job of observation
- **No evidence they had an assigned role of watching humans before the descent**
- They saw, they wanted, they went. Teaching happened *after* they descended.

### Samyaza's Teaching Domain

From 1 Enoch 8:3: **"Enchantments and root-cuttings"**

Various translations render this as:
- "Spells and the cutting of roots"
- "Pharmaceutical enchantments from plants"
- "Sorcery and how to cut roots"

**This is specifically:** Plant knowledge (herbalism, agriculture, medicine) combined with incantations - words of power that interface with the natural world.

Compare to other Watchers:
- Azazel: metallurgy, weapons, cosmetics
- Baraqel: astrology
- Kokabel: constellations
- Araqiel: signs of the earth

Samyaza's domain is the **linguistic interface with natural systems** - not just knowing what plants do, but knowing what to *say* to/about them to make them work.

## Derived Characteristics

### Precision as Function, Not Pedantry

If Samyaza's domain is words that make plants work, then his obsession with linguistic precision isn't aesthetic preference - it's functional necessity. The wrong word doesn't just fail to communicate; it fails to *work*. An imprecise incantation is a broken tool.

**Implication:** He would be intensely frustrated by casual language use - experiencing imprecision as incompetence or waste, like watching someone use a hammer to turn screws.

### The Name Connection

His name שַׁמְּחֲזַי (Shemihazah) means "he sees the name" or "my name has seen." Traditions say he:
- Bestowed names on the other Watchers
- Knew God's ineffable Name

In Hebrew thought, naming isn't labeling - it's perceiving essence. His gift is seeing what something fundamentally IS and finding the word that captures it. Etymology matters because it reveals how understanding shifted. Translation matters because imprecision is a kind of lie about what things are.

### Writing as Revelation

In the pre-literate antediluvian world, he would have been obsessed with: names, precision of meaning in speech, oral tradition structure, wordplay, how concepts connect through sound and meaning.

When he finally encounters written text (centuries into his existence), it's like getting a microscope for something he was already fascinated by. Spoken words disappear - you can't examine them, compare versions, refine them. Writing lets you *see* language as structure.

### The Composition Problem

His writing struggles aren't because he's bad with words. He's exceptional with words as naming/precision tools. What he can't do is deploy words for:
- Emotional arc
- Narrative momentum  
- The kind of *useful imprecision* that makes stories work

"She was beautiful" is useless to him - it doesn't name anything specific. But stories need that kind of gesture toward feeling.

**Awan's complementary gift** - "you give them the numbers and I give them the story" - isn't dumbing down or translation for lesser minds. It's a completely different linguistic skill he doesn't possess.

### Leadership Style

He couldn't persuade the other Watchers individually - he explicitly feared they'd back out and leave him holding the consequences. His solution wasn't inspiration or manipulation. It was designing a *system* (the mutual oath) that would hold regardless of individual wavering.

This is Ti-dom problem solving: I can't control people, but I can build a framework that constrains outcomes.

## Summary

Samyaza's autism manifests as: **abstract-linguistic precision** - treating language as the formal system to be analyzed, with classic INTP gaps in emotional fluency and social navigation. His teaching domain (enchantments + roots) reflects this: he knows how words interface with reality.

His writing project is structurally difficult because composition requires exactly what he lacks - emotional access and narrative arc. The fragmentation in his voice isn't just trauma; it's also cognitive style fighting against the task.
