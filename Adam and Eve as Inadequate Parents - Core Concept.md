# Adam and Eve as Inadequate Parents - Core Concept
## The Fundamental Problem: Created vs. Born Experience

### The Knowledge Gap

Adam and Eve possessed **immediate, complete adult knowledge and language** from the moment of creation. They never experienced:

- Not knowing how to speak
- Learning to walk
- The gradual development of understanding
- Physical helplessness or dependency
- The process of acquiring knowledge sequentially

### The Theological Paradox of Their Knowledge

- Gained cognitive understanding of right/wrong from the Tree
- But first response was morally questionable (blame-shifting)
- **Incomplete moral development**: Cognitive but not behavioral, self-protective rather than principled
- Tree gave moral awareness but not moral maturity
