I need to decide how I feel about the meanings of the various characters' names.  It seems like I should understand that.  I think I still want to avoid modern interpretations but the literal meanings of their names seems pretty relevant.  Or not.  I don't want to view them as symbols.  I want to take them literally.  Maybe I should just be aware of the meanings of their names without actively trying to leverage them 

Look into timeline question from Claude
- The research uncovered a **chronological tension** between your specified timeline (Awan living Years 8-83) and traditional Jewish chronologies from Jubilees, which place Awan's birth around Years 78-84. Similarly, while you specify Watchers arriving in Year 38, traditional sources place their descent during Jared's time (around Year 622).
- I may need to maintain multiple timelines and pick and choose from them.  I don't want to forget where I made a deliberate decision to deviate or switch

Remember to remove stuff from this list that's already been done or is no longer applicable

Figure out how to show, not tell
- focus on things that happened because of the things I want to explore
- focus on the ramifications of [[god]]'s actions, not on the actions themselves

Because [[samyaza]] possibly met [[Awan]] after her childbearing years, she may have been bored and lonely for the first time.  Her husband was busy building a city - a massive undertaking.

The only thing [[god]] valued was loyalty to him.
- Maybe there's a better word than loyalty

Think about devices as a top level directory.  voice and tense.  Flora and fauna.  Weather.  Maybe seasons isn't a good category.

Start identifying Claude conversations that haven't been captured in Obsidian.  Come up with a scheme for recognizing which conversations have been done and for being able to go back to a conversation to discuss a note in obsidian.  Maybe need a note for each conversation with the last thing captured in a directory called Claude Conversations

Key themes that I've definitely decided on that violate conventional wisdom may need to go in the instructions.  I've had to repeat myself multiple times about Abel's death.  Here's an example that I can mine for instructions:
- One thing that occurs to me about "Love Without Models" is that I'm not convinced that she'd have any problem with it. I'm not sure if what [[Cain]] did was intentional. How would he even have known that he could kill Abel? They'd never even seen anybody die, let alone seen that it was possible to kill. They kind of had to take [[god]]'s word for it that it was bad. "Am i my brother's keeper" could have been meant unironically, which is probably the more likely case than him having the sophistication to lie or misrepresent.

I need to figure out when to use the folder view and when to use the graph view and how to organize both for maximum pleasure.

Ultimately, this vault is completely mine and should probably consist mostly of my words in a way that makes sense to me.  The only thing needed here relative to Claude is that everything here needs to be available to Claude so he knows what I've been working on.

Think about whether or not I really need to link stuff, as I can always view the unlinked mentions
* If I don't, then they don't show up in the graph

There's probably no substitute for methodically reviewing each and every chat for stuff worth recording in Obsidian.  Claude is great for bouncing ideas and getting research, but I don't think it's a good tool for organizing as I need it to fit my particular needs, not some general notion of what seems like a good organization.  It does a good job of making things look organized, but that's really not what I need.  I should probably delete nearly all these notes and start all over, except for this.

It might be the case that this repo is read only for Claude.  Only my words or source material should go in here.  I should rephrase anything that I think Claude told me that I think is worth remembering.
