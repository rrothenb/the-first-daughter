I probably want to cover some things that aren't literally called for, like maybe incidents in Awan's life in regards to Abel, Cain, Adam, Eve, her children, her other siblings, her niblings, her nephilim offspring.  Some of these will be needed to elaborate on other ideas I want to explore, like their natural morality.  So I think these sorts of things don't get topics created for them, at least no initially, but maybe never

I need something minimal to do that will help me proceed. I’m thinking a folder called something like cover or include or topics or other that includes a note for each thing I want to include. Sort of chapters. Start by just listing everything I want to include. Like an outline. I like working that way. 

Maybe I’m ready for a less engineery phase of development
- Make lists of things I want to talk about and things I need to talk about and work out from those
	- not necessarily less engineery 
	- This does feel important
	- I also may need reasons for why I need to talk about it
		- why in gods name would I want to do that?
	- I kind of maybe need some sense as to how much I need to make a book
		- there’s so much I want to talk about, I doubt if I’ll have trouble finding stuff
- Will my big ass paper tablet fit in my suitcase?
	- is that really going to be helpful?
- I do need to do something since I seem to be stuck
	- My perceived need to cleanup is both possibly unnecessary and definitely painful so I should try to find something else to do
	- Even though the notes aren’t perfect, I still have a decent idea in my head about what I want to do
	- It might be a good exercise to try and do more stuff myself, rather than depending on Claude for everything
- I may be ready to lay out the actual sjuzhet

Consider drawing a big ass chart with color coding

Consider building a chronology
- Perhaps separate chronologies for Samyaza and Awan
- Include Samyaza’s “birth” and the story of the watchers
- Time didn’t start until the 4th day
- Include every time Samyaza learned something 
- Every subject he wants to talk about comes from an event when he learned something or it’s something he was born with 
- It seems useful to know the chronology even if it’s not presented that way 

I need to read and reread all of the research I currently have
- I need to remove anything no longer relevant
- I need to immerse myself in the relevant information I do have, particularly where I’m not that familiar with it
- I need to see what new questions that leads me to

I have so much work to do
- I have to figure out the granularity issue for all kinds of things
- I’ve got to clean up everything in there
- I think I’ve got to separate true research stuff from invented assertions 
- I’ve got to figure out a way to enjoy this process enough so that I actually do it
- I need to figure out a way to get to a point where I want to write

Figure out the right granularity
- Would it make sense to record assertions?
	- Examples
		- Adam & Eve were shitty parents
		- Awan and siblings didn't have a big issue with nudity
			- Depends on knowing the above issue
	- What would be the upshot of doing this?
		- A shit ton of notes and links
		- More opportunities to jump to related topics
		- More clarity on what ought to be covered somewhere
	- Easier to make sure assertions are referenced by Summary or could rename to Assertions
- It might work well for me if no note was more than a page in length 

Figure out the strategy for picking next topic, which will help me to understand the categories of notes

Review and fix every Research item

Any part of a research item that is actually a specific choice for the book, move to top or think of new directory

Make sure [[Summary]] has all important decisions in it and links to foundational topics like the one for the biblical voice

Make sure instructions describes using [[Summary]] first. 

Need to decide specifically what relations I need to model
- Trauma/emotion/feeling
- Location/place/milieu/environment
- Season/weather/time/temperature
- Activity

Should I model character to character relations?  Or anything other than event -> something?  If the purpose of the relations is to build a path tying events, then it seems like that's the only thing that should be traced.  Or maybe higher degree concepts so could model like type of for connecting events

I’m not sure where to start in cleaning up this bloated vault. There’s a lot that’s wrong or redundant. I need to find where Claude proposed guilt as something Samyaza would experience and delete that

I think that cleaning up the vault is higher priority than general reading and looking for things that excite me

I think my next step is primarily just reading stuff and making notes on the stuff that excites or interests or puzzles me.  In order to write an engaging novel I need engaging material

Try to show more than tell.  I’m tempted to explain literary theories rather than show them, although I don’t know if that’s even possible 

Stuff I need
- I need one file that contains everything I currently intend to cover at a high level.  Currently, that's the top level Summary note
- I need a directory for archived stuff that I'm not yet ready to delete, but it shouldn't really have all that much in it
- I need a directory for collateral (?) that's probably going to be used and is almost certainly true.  Maybe reference would be a better name.  It is not specific to the novel.  It shouldn't be a simple cut and paste from some site that I can simply reference with a URL, like sefaria.org.  This is a good place for reports I generated using Claude
- I need a directory for things that I think are true for the novel
- I shouldn't have anything at the top level that I want Claude to search.  Maybe the only thing at top level is this file

More stuff
- Look for a list of events to seed the events directory
- Create research directory and put docs generated by Claude that’s not book specific in there. Probably need to split up some files to do that as Claude likes to add a bit at the end tying the content to the book
- Create directories for characters, places, traumas, and anything else that could tie two events together in your mind that might connect them
- add stuff about viewing through modern trauma neuroscience lens to the main info about the book
- Return to the book also being about writing
- Make notes atomic
- Start making some real progress on notes
- Figure out if folder better than meta note (could really just do both)
- Really need to read the texts more and get in depth translation details whenever I find anything interesting 
- Read Nietzsche’s Genealogy of Morals
- Think show don’t tell - I can use an encyclopedic knowledge of the valley, the Bible, writing, and trauma without trying to teach everyone all about it. They can google that shit for themselves

I need to decide how I feel about the meanings of the various characters' names.  It seems like I should understand that.  I think I still want to avoid modern interpretations but the literal meanings of their names seems pretty relevant.  Or not.  I don't want to view them as symbols.  I want to take them literally.  Maybe I should just be aware of the meanings of their names without actively trying to leverage them
- Then again, it's pretty postmodern to be aware of the text.  Maybe I should lean into that

Think about devices as a top level directory.  voice and tense.  Flora and fauna.  Weather.  Maybe seasons isn't a good category.  What about Things, Activities, Times?  Foods?  Weather?

I need to figure out when to use the folder view and when to use the graph view and how to organize both for maximum pleasure.

Other potential folders
- Places
- Times
- Colors
- Events
- Flora
- Fauna
- Geography
- Weather
- Activities
- Morals
- Notes
- Uncategorized
- Sounds
- Smells
- Textures
- Sights
