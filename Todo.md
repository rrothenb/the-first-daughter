Probably need to stop asking Claude for summaries as I don't think I like them.  Better for me to cut out the pieces I like.

Maybe the next phase of this process is just figuring out how to use Obsidian in a way that works for me.

I need to figure out when to use the folder view and when to use the graph view and how to organize both for maximum pleasure.

The names that Claude is coming up with suck.  I don't have a clear organization here.  I don't know how to find stuff.

Ultimately, this vault is completely mine and should probably consist mostly of my words in a way that makes sense to me.  The only thing needed here relative to Claude is that everything here needs to be available to Claude so he knows what I've been working on.

Think about whether or not I really need to link stuff, as I can always view the unlinked mentions
* If I don't, then they don't show up in the graph

There's probably no substitute for methodically reviewing each and every chat for stuff worth recording in Obsidian.  Claude is great for bouncing ideas and getting research, but I don't think it's a good tool for organizing as I need it to fit my particular needs, not some general notion of what seems like a good organization.  It does a good job of making things look organized, but that's really not what I need.  I should probably delete nearly all these notes and start all over, except for this.

It might be the case that this repo is read only for Claude.  Only my words or source material should go in here.  I should rephrase anything that I think Claude told me that I think is worth remembering.

Might want to rename Sefaria folder to Sources
