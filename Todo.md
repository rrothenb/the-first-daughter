I’m not sure where to start in cleaning up this bloated vault. There’s a lot that’s wrong or redundant. I need to find where Claude proposed guilt as something Samyaza would experience and delete that

I think that cleaning up the vault is higher priority than general reading and looking for things that excite me

I think my next step is primarily just reading stuff and making notes on the stuff that excites or interests or puzzles me.  In order to write an engaging novel I need engaging material

Try to show more than tell.  I’m tempted to explain literary theories rather than show them, although I don’t know if that’s even possible 

Stuff I need
- I need one file that contains everything I currently intend to cover at a high level.  Currently, that's the top level Summary note
- I need a directory for archived stuff that I'm not yet ready to delete, but it shouldn't really have all that much in it
- I need a directory for collateral (?) that's probably going to be used and is almost certainly true.  Maybe reference would be a better name.  It is not specific to the novel.  It shouldn't be a simple cut and paste from some site that I can simply reference with a URL, like sefaria.org.  This is a good place for reports I generated using Claude
- I need a directory for things that I think are true for the novel
- I shouldn't have anything at the top level that I want Claude to search.  Maybe the only thing at top level is this file

More stuff
- Look for a list of events to seed the events directory
- Create research directory and put docs generated by Claude that’s not book specific in there. Probably need to split up some files to do that as Claude likes to add a bit at the end tying the content to the book
- Create directories for characters, places, traumas, and anything else that could tie two events together in your mind that might connect them
- add stuff about viewing through modern trauma neuroscience lens to the main info about the book
- Return to the book also being about writing
- Make notes atomic
- Start making some real progress on notes
- Figure out if folder better than meta note (could really just do both)
- Really need to read the texts more and get in depth translation details whenever I find anything interesting 
- Read Nietzsche’s Genealogy of Morals
- Think show don’t tell - I can use an encyclopedic knowledge of the valley, the Bible, writing, and trauma without trying to teach everyone all about it. They can google that shit for themselves

I need to decide how I feel about the meanings of the various characters' names.  It seems like I should understand that.  I think I still want to avoid modern interpretations but the literal meanings of their names seems pretty relevant.  Or not.  I don't want to view them as symbols.  I want to take them literally.  Maybe I should just be aware of the meanings of their names without actively trying to leverage them
- Then again, it's pretty postmodern to be aware of the text.  Maybe I should lean into that

Think about devices as a top level directory.  voice and tense.  Flora and fauna.  Weather.  Maybe seasons isn't a good category.  What about Things, Activities, Times?  Foods?  Weather?

I need to figure out when to use the folder view and when to use the graph view and how to organize both for maximum pleasure.

Other potential folders

- Fauna
- Geography
- Weather
