Think about devices as a top level directory.  voice and tense.  Flora and fauna.  Weather.  Maybe seasons isn't a good category.  What about Things, Activities, Times?  Foods?  Weather?

Start identifying Claude conversations that haven't been captured in Obsidian.  Come up with a scheme for recognizing which conversations have been done and for being able to go back to a conversation to discuss a note in obsidian.  Maybe need a note for each conversation with the last thing captured in a directory called Claude Conversations

Add the instructions I had Claude come up with for the timeline and for avoiding traditional morality assumptions

Key themes that I've definitely decided on that violate conventional wisdom may need to go in the instructions.  I've had to repeat myself multiple times about Abel's death.  Here's an example that I can mine for instructions:
- One thing that occurs to me about "Love Without Models" is that I'm not convinced that she'd have any problem with it. I'm not sure if what Cain did was intentional. How would he even have known that he could kill Abel? They'd never even seen anybody die, let alone seen that it was possible to kill. They kind of had to take god's word for it that it was bad. "Am i my brother's keeper" could have been meant unironically, which is probably the more likely case than him having the sophistication to lie or misrepresent.

OK.  This is SO not working.  There's already too much stuff in this repo.  I have to be more efficient. I shouldn't duplicate any text, just provide links to relevant documents.  I shouldn't duplicate anything already in a conversation, just provide maybe the name of the conversation or maybe the shared link to it.  Claude is for research and brainstorming.  Obsidian is for succinct notes that will inform the actual novel.  Stuff that will be used to construct it.  Nothing extraneous.  I don't need to know where stuff is in the conversations of a project because I should always be able to ask Claude to look for them.

Probably need to stop asking Claude for summaries as I don't think I like them.  Better for me to cut out the pieces I like.

Maybe the next phase of this process is just figuring out how to use Obsidian in a way that works for me.

I need to figure out when to use the folder view and when to use the graph view and how to organize both for maximum pleasure.

The names that Claude is coming up with suck.  I don't have a clear organization here.  I don't know how to find stuff.

Ultimately, this vault is completely mine and should probably consist mostly of my words in a way that makes sense to me.  The only thing needed here relative to Claude is that everything here needs to be available to Claude so he knows what I've been working on.

Think about whether or not I really need to link stuff, as I can always view the unlinked mentions
* If I don't, then they don't show up in the graph

There's probably no substitute for methodically reviewing each and every chat for stuff worth recording in Obsidian.  Claude is great for bouncing ideas and getting research, but I don't think it's a good tool for organizing as I need it to fit my particular needs, not some general notion of what seems like a good organization.  It does a good job of making things look organized, but that's really not what I need.  I should probably delete nearly all these notes and start all over, except for this.

It might be the case that this repo is read only for Claude.  Only my words or source material should go in here.  I should rephrase anything that I think Claude told me that I think is worth remembering.

Might want to rename Sefaria folder to Sources

Probably want no more than one deep folder structure
