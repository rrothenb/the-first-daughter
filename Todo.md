Probably need to stop asking Claude for summaries as I don't think I like them.  Better for me to cut out the pieces I like.

Maybe the next phase of this process is just figuring out how to use Obsidian in a way that works for me.

I need to figure out when to use the folder view and when to use the graph view and how to organize both for maximum pleasure.

The names that Claude is coming up with suck.  I don't have a clear organization here.  I don't know how to find stuff.

Ultimately, this vault is completely mine and should probably consist mostly of my words in a way that makes sense to me.  The only thing needed here relative to Claude is that everything here needs to be available to Claude so he knows what I've been working on.

Think about whether or not I really need to link stuff, as I can always view the unlinked mentions
