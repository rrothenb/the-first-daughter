## Core Insight

Samyaza's unreliability as narrator isn't a bug—it's thematically load-bearing. His possible inflation of his connection to Awan, his obsessive need to "correct" the record, these are themselves evidence of what the weaponization of religion does to people. Even the witness trying to recover the truth has been warped by centuries of damage.

## The Psychology

As someone on the spectrum who experienced the mission system—forced assimilation, erasure of identity, physical and spiritual abuse—clinging to a narrative where he had a meaningful connection to Awan makes psychological sense. She becomes an internal refuge.

His obsession with "setting the record straight" could be:
- Externalizing internal pain (it's not about *my* wounds, it's about *her* story)
- A meaning-making exercise that keeps him functional across centuries
- Autistic pattern-completion—if the story is *wrong*, it must be *fixed*
- Repetition compulsion around the original trauma of watching narratives get distorted

## What Actually Happened?

He might have seen her once. Maybe they exchanged a few words. Maybe she was kind to him in some small way that lodged because kindness was rare, or because something about her registered as *safe*. Or maybe he just observed her from a distance and constructed an entire relationship.

The centuries of trauma calcified whatever that original connection was (or wasn't) into something load-bearing. She became the symbol of everything lost, everything good before the distortions set in.

**This doesn't make his feelings less real or his grief less valid.** He's not lying—he believes every word. He's just been telling himself this story for so long that the distinction between memory and meaning has collapsed.

## Writing Implications

- He doesn't need a "good reason" for his obsession. Obsession doesn't require justification proportional to its intensity.
- Room for moments of painful near-self-awareness. Flickers where he almost sees it. He pulls back from those edges.
- His voice carries the damage—affects how much the reader should trust his framing versus his facts.
- He may believe that Awan loved him and later, when he learns about the Westermarck effect, might have a moment of questioning that.

## The Larger Point

The novel uses Awan as entry point but is fundamentally about **the mechanics of narrative weaponization and how it produced our current cruelty**.

Readers come in thinking they're getting a biblical retelling. They get emotionally invested in Awan. The meta-structure reveals that the act of distorting her story is the same act that justified everything from witch burnings to residential schools to purity culture.

Samyaza's unreliability strengthens this. Because even the person trying to correct the record can't fully escape the damage. He's been marinating in a broken world for millennia. His obsession, his possible inflation of his connection—that's *also* what the weaponization does to people. It warps how we attach, how we remember, what we cling to.

**The cruelty isn't just in the systems. It's in what it did to the survivors trying to remember what was lost.**
