### The Othering Hypothesis

- Humans can only judge negatively those they can psychologically distance themselves from
- [[Awan]] exists in a world where "othering" is literally impossible
    - Knows every person from birth
    - Knows their complete life story, parents, struggles, context
    - No abstract "bad people" - only specific individuals with known histories

### [[Awan]]'s Unique Moral Position

- **No Dehumanization**: Witnessed everyone as babies, children, developing humans
- **No Categorical Thinking**: Cannot reduce anyone to stereotypes or group membership
- **No Selective Exposure**: Cannot avoid learning about people's positive qualities
- **Complete Context**: Knows everyone's trauma, struggles, reasons for behavior

### Implications for Her Character

- More compassionate but potentially morally paralyzed
- Unable to engage in simplified moral categories that enable justice
- Possibly the first human to experience true universal empathy
- Vulnerable to moral exhaustion from inability to distance from others' pain
- When [[Cain]] kills Abel, she knows her brother's full humanity, not just "a murderer"

### Original Human Consciousness

- [[Awan]]'s perspective wasn't unusual - it was the original human condition
- The ability to "other" is a later cognitive development
- Emerged as defense mechanism when populations grew beyond knowing everyone
