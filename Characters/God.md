# God

**Basic Information:** The divine creator, primary authority figure in Genesis narrative, source of moral law and cosmic power. The name YHWH (LORD) is used alongside Elohim (God).

**Traditional Framework:** God is:

- Omniscient (all-knowing)
- Omnipotent (all-powerful)
- Omnibenevolent (all-good)
- Just and righteous
- Loving father figure
- Source of moral truth
- Worthy of worship and obedience

**Your Natural Morality Framework:** God is:

- Narcissistic entity demanding worship
- Controlling authority restricting human development
- Insecure about human potential
- Arbitrary in judgments and preferences
- Abusive in punishment
- Source of dysfunction, not morality
- Antagonist preventing human flourishing

**Actions in Genesis 1-6:**

_Creation:_

- Made the world in six days
- Created humans in his image
- Placed them in Eden with restrictions
- Gave one prohibition without clear justification

_In Eden:_

- Forbade tree of knowledge of good and evil
- Warning: "in the day you eat of it you shall surely die"
- Did not explain why knowledge was forbidden
- Did not prevent serpent from entering garden
- Did not stop Eve from eating

_After the Fall:_

- Confronted Adam and Eve
- Cursed serpent, woman, man, and ground
- Expelled them from Eden
- Blocked re-entry with cherubim and flaming sword
- Made re-entry physically impossible

_With Cain and Abel:_

- Accepted Abel's offering without explanation
- Rejected Cain's offering without explanation
- Warning to Cain: "sin is crouching at your door"
- After murder, confronted Cain
- Marked Cain but also protected him
- Cursed Cain to be wanderer but kept him alive

_Pre-Flood:_

- Saw human wickedness increasing
- Saw Watchers descending and interacting with humans
- Saw Nephilim being born
- Decided to destroy almost everything
- Chose Noah alone as righteous
- Planned the Flood

**Character Psychology (Your Framework):**

_Dramatica Elements:_

- **Avoid/Prevent** - actively stops human empowerment and knowledge
- **Hinder** - obstructs human development and potential
- **Oppose** - works against human agency and choice
- **Control** (absolute) - demands total obedience without question
- **Disbelief** (in human capacity) - doesn't trust humans with knowledge or power
- **Inequity** - applies unfair, arbitrary standards (Abel vs. Cain)
- **Certainty** (absolute) - demands submission to divine will without explanation
- **Order** (oppressive) - his order restricts rather than liberates
- **Inertia** (regarding humans) - wants humans to stay dependent and unchanging
- **Uncontrolled** (in responses) - reacts with disproportionate punishment (Flood for human development)

Traditional framework would assign:

- **Conscience**, **Help**, **Faith** (humans having faith in God)

But in your framework:

- **Temptation** (through false promises - "you shall surely die")
- **Hinder** (prevents knowledge access deliberately)
- **Oppose** (works against human flourishing consistently)

_Personality Dimensions:_

- **Agency**: Proactive-Active (creates, commands, enforces actively)
- **Social Orientation**: Outgoing but Withdrawn (speaks/appears but distances emotionally)
- **Cognitive Mode**: Absolute-Authoritarian (demands compliance, brooks no questions)
- **Emotional Regulation**: Volatile-Punitive (curses, expels, destroys disproportionately)
- **Spiritual Approach**: Narcissistic-Controlling (requires worship and absolute obedience)
- **Temporal Focus**: Eternal but insecure (fears human development despite timeless existence)
- **Interpersonal Style**: Demanding-Deceptive (commands but misleads with unclear warnings)
- **Will Orientation**: Absolutely dominant (permits zero challenge or autonomy)

**Story Function:** In your framework, God is the **Antagonist** - the one who:

- Prevents human knowledge and growth
- Opposes human agency and choice
- Hinders relationships (Watchers with humans)
- Uses Control and Inequity to maintain dominance
- Responds to challenges with destruction (the Flood)

**Key Actions Analyzed:**

_"You Shall Surely Die":_ Genesis 2:17: "in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die"

Problems:

- They didn't die that day
- From Adam/Eve's perspective, God's warning was false
- Serpent's prediction ("you will not surely die") proved more accurate
- This breaks trust - first divine statement they can test proves misleading
- Later theological explanations (spiritual death, mortality introduced) are retrospective rationalizations

In your framework: Functions as **Temptation-through-false-promise** and **Hinder-through-fear**. God uses unclear threat to prevent knowledge access.

_Abel vs. Cain:_ Genesis 4:3-5: "the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard."

Problems:

- No explanation given
- Both brothers offered fruits of their labor
- Arbitrary preference creates jealousy
- Divine favoritism directly contributes to first murder
- Cain's sense of Inequity is justified

In your framework: God's arbitrary preference demonstrates divine narcissism - he liked Abel's approach better for unexplained reasons, creating family dysfunction.

_The Curse on Eve:_ Genesis 3:16: "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you."

This specifically targets:

- Her biology (painful childbirth)
- Her psychology (desire for husband who dominates)
- Her autonomy (male rule imposed)

In your framework: Punishment for seeking knowledge targets female biology and agency specifically. God punishes the questioner more severely than the passive follower (Adam's curse is lighter).

_The Flood Decision:_ Genesis 6:5-7: "The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great...And the LORD regretted that he had made man...So the LORD said, 'I will blot out man whom I have created.'"

Problems:

- Collective punishment for some individuals' actions
- Destroys innocent along with guilty (children, animals)
- "Regretted" suggests God didn't foresee this (challenges omniscience)
- Disproportionate response - murder everything rather than targeted intervention
- Alternative solutions available (educate, guide, warn) ignored

In your framework: Ultimate **Oppose** - when losing control of human development (knowledge from Watchers, technological advancement, human-angel relationships), God destroys nearly everything. The Antagonist's climactic act when threatened.

**Inconsistencies:**

_Protection and Punishment:_

- Marks Cain to protect him (don't kill) but curses him to wander (punishment)
- Expels from Eden but guards it (why guard if they can't return anyway?)
- Loves creation enough to make it but destroys it in Flood
- Wants humans to worship but makes worship dangerous (Abel's favor sparked murder)

_Knowledge and Ignorance:_

- Creates humans capable of understanding good/evil
- Forbids access to that knowledge
- Punishes them for gaining it
- Then expects them to make moral choices without full knowledge

_Power and Regret:_

- Omnipotent but regrets creation outcome
- All-knowing but surprised by human wickedness
- All-powerful but uses Flood instead of targeted solution

**Relationship with Humans:**

_With Adam:_

- Created him without his consent
- Placed restrictions without explanation
- Expelled him for disobedience
- Cursed his work to be painful

_With Eve:_

- Created her as "helper" for Adam (subordinate role)
- She questioned and explored (used the mind God gave her)
- Punished her biology and autonomy specifically
- Made her subject to male rule

_With Abel:_

- Accepted his offering (creating favoritism)
- This acceptance contributed to his death
- Abel represented the "right" worship but died young

_With Cain:_

- Rejected his offering arbitrarily
- Warning came too late (after jealousy formed)
- Marked and cursed him but kept him alive
- Complex mix of punishment and protection

_With Watchers:_

- They descended to help/corrupt (depending on view)
- God imprisons them eternally
- Destroys their children (Nephilim)
- Uses their actions as justification for Flood

_With Noah:_

- Found him righteous amid wickedness
- Saved only his family
- Destroyed everyone else including children

**Divine Walking in Eden:** Genesis 3:8: "They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day."

Implications:

- God had physical presence (or appearance of it)
- Walked regularly in Eden (routine interaction)
- Made sound when moving (physical manifestation)
- Appeared at specific times ("cool of day")

Questions:

- What did God look like?
- Was God clothed?
- Did God have gendered features?
- Why walk if omnipresent?

Traditional answer: Anthropomorphic language for divine presence Your framework: God manifested physically to maintain control and surveillance

**Divine Preferences:**

What God seems to value:

- Obedience without question
- Worship and acknowledgment
- Blood sacrifices (Abel's) over plant offerings (Cain's)
- Passivity (Adam) over curiosity (Eve)
- Faith without proof
- Human dependence on divine authority

What God seems to oppose:

- Human autonomy and choice
- Knowledge and enlightenment
- Questions and challenges
- Human-angel relationships
- Technological/cultural development
- Anything threatening divine supremacy

**The Omni-Problem:**

If God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent:

- He knew Adam and Eve would eat the fruit (omniscience)
- He could have prevented it (omnipotence)
- He chose not to prevent it, then punished them (challenges omnibenevolence)

Similarly:

- He knew Cain would murder Abel
- He could have prevented it
- He chose not to, then punished Cain

And:

- He knew Watchers would descend
- He knew humans would develop
- He chose to create and then destroy

This pattern suggests either:

- God isn't omniscient (didn't know)
- God isn't omnipotent (couldn't prevent)
- God isn't omnibenevolent (chose not to prevent harmful outcomes)

Traditional theology handles this with "free will" doctrine. Your framework: God deliberately creates conditions for failure, then punishes those who fail.

**Communication Style:**

God rarely explains:

- Why is knowledge forbidden? (Not explained to Adam/Eve)
- Why is Abel's offering accepted? (Not explained to Cain)
- Why must humans wear clothes now? (Shame imposed but not discussed)
- Why is mortality the consequence? (Mechanism not explained)
- Why destroy everyone for some's wickedness? (Justice not demonstrated)

This lack of explanation maintains:

- Divine mystery and authority
- Human confusion and dependence
- No accountability for divine decisions
- No appeals process

**Thematic Significance:**

_For "How Did We Get Here?":_

- God's arbitrary preferences create family dysfunction (Abel/Cain)
- Divine punishment creates harsh conditions (exile from Eden)
- God's control prevents human flourishing
- Fear of divine wrath shapes human behavior
- Humans develop despite, not because of, divine guidance

_For "Destructive Divine Directives":_

- Every command God gives creates harm
- "Don't eat" leads to shame, exile, pain
- Favoring Abel leads to murder
- Restricting knowledge stunts development
- Flooding world destroys innocents
- God is primary source of trauma and dysfunction

_For "Question Authority":_

- God demands unquestioning obedience
- Eve questions and is punished
- Cain questions ("Am I my brother's keeper?") and is cursed
- Watchers defy and are imprisoned
- Pattern: questioning divine authority brings destruction

**Natural Conflicts:** In your framework, God opposes:

- **Eve** (Pursue + Test + Knowledge) - she challenges his Prevent
- **Awan** (Logic + Questioning) - she analyzes his contradictions
- **Samyaza** (Help + Knowledge + Liberation) - he opposes his Control
- **Human development itself** - fears what they might become

**The Flood as Ultimate Antagonism:** When humans develop too much:

- Cities (Cain)
- Technology (his lineage)
- Knowledge (from Watchers)
- Angel relationships
- Independent capability

God's response: Destroy it all. Ultimate **Oppose** and **Prevent**. The Antagonist's climactic act when losing control.

**Alternative Interpretation Problems:**

Could God be:

- Testing humans? (Seems cruel - creating situations for failure)
- Teaching lessons? (Destroys rather than educates)
- Protecting humans? (From what? Knowledge and development?)
- Loving in mysterious ways? (Love that tortures and destroys is abuse)

Your framework rejects these theodicies as rationalization of divine abuse.

**Narrative Perspective:** From Awan's analytical viewpoint: The deity who:

- Deceived her parents ("you shall surely die that day" = false)
- Favored her brother Abel (triggering his murder)
- Punished her mother Eve for seeking knowledge
- Made her marry Abel's killer through circumstances
- Created world of pain and hardship
- Demands worship despite all this
- Will eventually destroy nearly everything

Her Logic + Questioning approach leads her to analyze God's actions objectively:

- Inconsistent (protects Cain but curses him)
- Arbitrary (Abel vs. Cain preference unexplained)
- Deceptive (warnings prove misleading)
- Controlling (restricts knowledge and autonomy)
- Insecure (fears human development)
- Abusive (disproportionate punishments)

She cannot worship this being with integrity. Her analytical mind won't allow her to ignore the evidence of divine dysfunction.
