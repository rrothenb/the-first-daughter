### Divine Psychological Patterns

Based on textual analysis (especially Jubilees):

- **Narcissistic traits**: Grandiose righteousness, need for constant worship
- **Paranoid features**: Obsessive focus on betrayal/abandonment
- **Borderline patterns**: Extreme splitting, unstable relationships
- **Control/Manipulation**: Sets up failure scenarios, then blames victims

### [[God]]'s Role in the Fall

- Created arbitrary prohibitions conflicting with natural curiosity (the tree)
- Introduced shame where none existed (nakedness)
- Modeled blame-shifting and punishment over restoration
- Created competitive dynamics ([[Cain]] and Abel's offerings)
- Made bizarre, unhelpful commandments against natural instincts

### The Corruption Thesis

- Divine intervention introduced moral confusion
- "Knowledge of good and evil" overrode naturally good human instincts
- Replaced embodied wisdom with artificial divine categories
- Created conflict between natural empathy and divine commands
