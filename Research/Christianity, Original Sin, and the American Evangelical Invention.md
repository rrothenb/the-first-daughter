## Overview

This document compiles research on the historical development of Christian doctrine, particularly Original Sin, the evolution from early Jerusalem Christianity to modern American evangelicalism, and which Christian groups reject Augustinian Original Sin.

## The Romans 5:12 Mistranslation

One of the most consequential translation errors in Western history.

### The Greek Original

The Greek text reads: **"ἐφ' ᾧ πάντες ἥμαρτον"** — meaning "because all sinned." This describes individual moral failure: each person sins on their own.

### The Latin Error

The Latin Vulgate rendered this as **"in quo omnes peccaverunt"** — "in whom all sinned." This transforms the meaning completely: all of humanity was somehow *literally present in Adam* when he sinned, and therefore shares his personal guilt.

### Augustine's Theology Built on the Mistranslation

Augustine of Hippo (354-430 CE) built an elaborate theology on this mistranslation:

- Every human is born condemned *before* committing any personal sin
- Human nature is fundamentally corrupted
- Guilt is transmitted through the sexual act itself (he called concupiscence "the daughter of sin")
- "Whatever comes into being by natural birth is bound by original sin"

### The Eastern Orthodox Never Accepted This

The Eastern Orthodox Church, reading the Greek directly rather than through Latin translation, never accepted Augustine's innovation. They distinguish between:

- **Ancestral sin**: Adam's personal act affecting mortality
- **Original sin**: Inherited guilt (which they reject)

Their theological emphasis on *theosis* (becoming like God through spiritual growth) rather than juridical acquittal produces a fundamentally different reading of Genesis 3.

### Earlier Church Fathers Disagreed with Augustine

- **Irenaeus of Lyon (c. 130-202 CE)**: Taught that Adam and Eve were created as *children*, not perfect beings who fell catastrophically. The Fall resulted in mortality, not inherited guilt.
- **Clement of Alexandria**: Denied any detrimental effects of Adam's sin on descendants at all.
- **Pelagius**: Taught that humans are born innocent and can choose good through their own efforts.

### Why Pelagius Lost

Pelagius's position was institutionally dangerous: if humans could achieve righteousness through moral effort, the church's sacraments became *optional* rather than essential. The councils that condemned Pelagianism (Carthage 418, Ephesus 431) were boundary-enforcement mechanisms that made the institutional church the sole gatekeeper of salvation.

The doctrine that every infant is born condemned created universal demand for baptism, which only the church could provide.

## Early Christianity Before Paul

### Timeline

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Jesus crucified | ~30-33 CE |
| Paul's conversion | ~31-36 CE |
| Paul's first letter (1 Thessalonians) | ~49-51 CE |
| Romans written | ~55-57 CE |
| Gospel of Mark | ~70 CE |
| Gospels of Matthew and Luke | ~80-90 CE |
| Gospel of John | ~90-100 CE |

**Critical insight**: Paul's letters are the earliest Christian documents we have. The Gospels were all written *after* Paul's letters.

### The Jerusalem Community

The earliest Christian community was centered in Jerusalem, led by the "three pillars":

1. **James** (Jesus's brother) — became the primary leader
2. **Peter** — initially prominent, later eclipsed by James
3. **John**

James hadn't even been a follower during Jesus's lifetime but had a resurrection vision and became the leader. The twelve apostles had known Jesus personally.

The community also included:
- "Hellenists" — Greek-speaking diaspora Jews who'd resettled in Jerusalem
- "Hebrews" — Aramaic-speaking Jews
- Converts who joined after the crucifixion

### Numbers (Highly Uncertain)

- Acts claims 120 believers right after the crucifixion, then 3,000 after Pentecost, then 5,000 soon after
- Modern scholars are skeptical — Rodney Stark estimates maybe 1,000 Christians by 40 CE
- By the time Paul writes Romans (~55-57 CE), there are scattered communities across the Mediterranean
- Maybe 7,000-10,000 total Christians in the empire by end of first century (some say 25,000)

### Pre-Pauline Beliefs About Christ

The earliest Christians weren't thinking in Augustinian "original sin" terms at all. Their message was:

1. **Jesus was the Messiah** — resurrected and exalted by God
2. **The Kingdom of God was imminent** — Jesus would return *soon* to establish it (apocalyptic eschatology)
3. **Repent and prepare** — get right with God before the end times
4. **Forgiveness of sins** — through baptism and joining the community

The earliest creed Paul quotes (1 Corinthians 15:3-7) says "Christ died for our sins" — but this was probably an apologetic explanation for why the Messiah had been crucified (which was scandalous). It wasn't yet the elaborate Adam-Christ typology Paul would develop.

The Jerusalem church under James was basically a Jewish sect — they kept Torah, went to the Temple, practiced circumcision.

### Paul's Innovation

Paul created the theological framework connecting Adam's sin to humanity's universal need for Christ's redemption — the architecture that Augustine would later weaponize.

Paul himself never met the historical Jesus (except possibly witnessing the crucifixion — he was in Jerusalem as a young Pharisee). His authority came from his vision on the Damascus road.

## James and the New Testament

### The Epistle of James

There is an Epistle of James in the New Testament, but whether the historical James actually wrote it is disputed.

**Case for authenticity:**
- Attributed to "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ"
- Very Jewish in flavor — heavy on ethics and practical behavior, light on Christology
- Emphasizes works over faith alone ("faith without works is dead") which aligns with the Jerusalem church's Torah-observant stance

**Case against authenticity:**
- Written in polished Greek — would Jesus's brother from Galilee have that level of Greek literacy?
- Doesn't claim to be from Jesus's brother specifically
- Many scholars date it late (80-100 CE), after James's death in 62 CE
- Doesn't reference James's authority as Jesus's brother or church leader

### The James-Paul Conflict

The Epistle of James and Paul's letters are in direct conflict on the faith vs. works question:

> "A person is justified by works and not by faith alone" (James 2:24)

This directly contradicts Paul's position in Romans and Galatians. Luther famously called James "an epistle of straw" and wanted it out of the canon.

This may reflect the actual historical conflict between James's Jerusalem faction (Torah-observant, works-focused) and Paul's Gentile mission (faith alone, Torah optional).

---

## James's Parentage

This is theologically contested, revealing denominational fault lines.

### The Straightforward Reading

Mark 6:3 and Matthew 13:55 name Jesus's brothers as James, Joses, Judas, and Simon, and mention sisters. The Greek word is *adelphos* (brother). If read plainly, James was a younger brother — Mary and Joseph's son born after Jesus.

### The Catholic Position (Jerome, 4th century)

*Adelphos* can mean "kinsman" or "cousin" in Semitic usage. James was actually Jesus's cousin. This preserves Mary's perpetual virginity.

### The Eastern Orthodox Position (Protoevangelium of James, 2nd century)

Joseph was an elderly widower with children from a previous marriage. James was Jesus's *older* stepbrother — Joseph's son, not Mary's. This also preserves Mary's perpetual virginity.

### What Seems Most Likely Historically

Paul calls James "the Lord's brother" (Galatians 1:19) without any hedging. The simplest reading is that Mary and Joseph had more children after Jesus, and James was one of them. The perpetual virginity doctrine came later and required creative reinterpretation.

## What All Christians Believe

Surprisingly little.

### Jesus?

All Christians consider Jesus central. But *how* varies enormously:
- **Trinitarians**: Jesus is God, second person of the Trinity
- **Arians** (early heresy, echoed in Jehovah's Witnesses): Jesus is a created being, not co-eternal with God
- **Unitarians**: Jesus was a great teacher, not divine
- **Mormons**: Jesus is divine but God was once a man, and humans can become gods
- **Gnostics**: Jesus was a spiritual being who revealed secret knowledge

### Resurrection?

Most Christians affirm the resurrection, but some liberal/progressive Christians interpret it metaphorically.

### The Bible?

Christians use the Bible, but which Bible?
- Protestants: 66 books
- Catholics: 73 books (includes deuterocanonical books)
- Ethiopian Orthodox: 81-88 books (includes 1 Enoch, Jubilees)

### Salvation Through Jesus?

Yes, but the mechanism:
- Faith alone (Luther)
- Faith + works (James, Catholicism)
- Sacraments necessary (Catholicism, Orthodoxy)
- Predestination (Calvinism)
- Universal salvation (some Universalists)

### What's Actually Universal?

Maybe just:
1. Jesus is uniquely important to understanding God and human salvation
2. Self-identification as Christian

Even the creeds (Nicene, Apostles') aren't accepted by all groups that call themselves Christian.

## American Evangelical Christianity: A Recent Invention

### The Hybrid Origins

American evangelicalism is not ancient Christianity. It's a specific hybrid:

- **Calvinist influence**: Puritans brought Reformed theology (predestination, total depravity, God's sovereignty)
- **Arminian influence**: The idea that you can *choose* to accept or reject Christ (actually anti-Calvinist)
- **Revivalism**: The Great Awakenings (18th-19th century) created the "conversion experience" emphasis

### Key Elements and Their Actual Origins

| Element | Claimed Origin | Actual Origin |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Biblical inerrancy | Ancient | Princeton Seminary, late 1800s; The Fundamentals pamphlets (1910-1915) |
| Personal conversion experience | Biblical | American revivalism, Great Awakenings (1730s-1840s) |
| "Accept Christ as personal Lord and Savior" | Biblical | 19th-20th century American revivalist language |
| The sinner's prayer | Biblical | 19th-20th century invention |
| Every believer must evangelize | Apostolic | Democratized by American revivalism (18th-19th century) |

### What Luther and Calvin Would Not Recognize

- The altar call
- The sinner's prayer
- "Asking Jesus into your heart"
- The datable moment when you "got saved"

For Luther and Calvin, baptism and catechesis made you Christian, not an emotional decision moment.

### The Political Merger (Very Recent)

The fusion of conservative Christianity with right-wing politics is largely post-1970s:

- Moral Majority (Jerry Falwell, 1979)
- Reaction to Roe v. Wade, school desegregation, removal of school prayer
- The "culture war" framing

Before this, evangelicals were actually somewhat politically disengaged — focused on personal salvation, not transforming society.

### The Internal Contradiction

American fundamentalists hold a position that's internally contradictory:

1. They accept Augustine's Original Sin framework (total depravity, humans born broken)
2. But they emphasize *choosing* to accept Christ (which implies free will and human capacity to respond to God)
3. This is basically the Pelagian position Augustine fought against

They've kept Augustinian pessimism about human nature while adopting a mechanism of salvation that assumes human agency. It's Augustinian anthropology with Pelagian soteriology.

## Prevalence of American Evangelicalism

### In the United States

Numbers depend heavily on definition:

| Definition | Percentage |
|------------|------------|
| Broad (self-identify as evangelical or born-again) | ~25-35% |
| Stricter theological definition | ~10-13% |
| White evangelical Protestants specifically | ~13% (and declining) |

Geographic concentration: the "Bible Belt" — Tennessee (52%), Alabama (49%), Kentucky (49%), Oklahoma (47%). Versus Utah (7%), Massachusetts (9%), DC (8%).

### The Decline Paradox

White evangelicals are a shrinking demographic that has *increased* its political mobilization and institutional capture:

- Supreme Court: 6-3 conservative supermajority
- State legislatures: abortion bans, anti-trans legislation, book bans
- School boards: exploding evangelical involvement post-COVID
- Trump coalition: 80%+ white evangelical vote

A movement can be demographically declining while politically ascendant. The siege mentality intensifies commitment among those who remain.

### Global Presence

American-style evangelicalism has been massively exported:

| Region | Evangelical Population | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Asia | 215 million | China (66M), India (28M), Indonesia (16M), Philippines (13M), South Korea (9M) |
| Africa | 185 million | Nigeria (58M), Kenya (20M), Ethiopia (18M) |
| Latin America | 123 million | Brazil (47M); 8,000 Latin Americans leaving Catholicism per day in late 1990s |
| North America | 107 million | US (93M), Mexico (10M), Canada (4M) |
| Europe | 23 million | UK (5M), Russia (2M), Ukraine (2M) |

By 2010, almost 70% of evangelicals lived *outside* the US and Europe.

### The Key Insight

The American political fusion — white Christian nationalism, the Trump alignment, the culture war — is *not* what global evangelicalism looks like:

- British evangelicals were crucial in the rise of the Labour Party
- Canada's democratic socialist NDP was founded by a Baptist pastor
- Latin American evangelicalism has sometimes aligned with leftist movements

The prosperity theology, the anti-LGBTQ politics, the Christian Zionism — American missionaries exported some of this, but it's not uniform.

White American evangelical Trumpism is "a lot more white and more American than it is evangelical."

## Groups That Reject Augustinian Original Sin

### Eastern Orthodox (~220-300 million, ~10-12% of all Christians)

The biggest group. They teach "ancestral sin" instead:

- We inherit the *consequences* of Adam's sin (mortality, a fallen world, tendency toward sin)
- We do NOT inherit *guilt*
- You're not born condemned
- Emphasis on *theosis* (becoming like God) rather than juridical acquittal

One Orthodox writer: "The Augustinian doctrine of Original Sin is wholly un-Orthodox, and it led to a whole series of heresies in the Latin Church, such as Predestination, Purgatory, Limbo and the Immaculate Conception."

### Latter-day Saints / Mormons (~17 million, <1%)

Second Article of Faith: "We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression."

- Children are born innocent
- No infant baptism
- The Fall was actually necessary and good: "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy"

### Smaller Groups

- Christadelphians — explicitly reject original sin
- Unitarian Universalists — reject it
- Quakers — generally reject it
- Christian Scientists — reject it
- Jehovah's Witnesses — modified view

### The Math

| Position | Approximate % of Christians |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Reject Augustinian Original Sin | ~13-15% |
| Accept some version of Original Sin | ~85%+ |

### The Historical Irony

The Orthodox position — which rejects inherited guilt and emphasizes human freedom and capacity for good — is actually *older* than Augustine's formulation. It's closer to what the early Greek-speaking church believed.

Augustinianism was the innovation. It only became "orthodox" (lowercase) in the West because Augustine won the institutional battle and the Eastern and Western churches split.

What American fundamentalists treat as ancient biblical truth is actually a 5th century Western invention that the oldest continuous Christian traditions explicitly reject.
