A Watcher imprisoned in the San Fernando Valley would witness an unbroken chain of human beings occupying the absolute bottom of society—each era producing its own taxonomy of the despised. This research reveals the specific subcategories of marginalized people who occupied the lowest rungs across 200+ years, with particular attention to daily life, grinding traumas, and the cruel mathematics of who looks down on whom.

## Pre-contact era (before 1769): The limits of the ethnographic record

The honest answer is that **we lack documentation of systematic oppression within pre-contact Tongva and Tataviam societies**. Spanish missionization (beginning 1771) disrupted these societies before comprehensive records existed. What survives comes from Hugo Reid's 1852 letters, written 80+ years after contact.

**Social hierarchy did exist.** Tongva society organized into three tiers: chiefs (*Tumia'r*), their families, successful artisans, and shamans at the top; families of long lineage in the middle; and general population at the bottom. However, unlike Pacific Northwest tribes where **25% were hereditary slaves**, Southern California coastal peoples appear not to have practiced institutionalized slavery.

**The most historically defensible "lowest position"** would be someone without clan protection—a refugee whose entire family line died, someone who violated reciprocity norms, or those who lost kinship connections entirely. Strong sharing ethics meant hoarding was deeply stigmatized. But depicting systematic cruelty toward such individuals isn't supported by the record and risks perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

For your Watcher character in this era: the most authentic experience would be **observation of relative egalitarianism** compared to what follows—perhaps witnessing the small-scale conflicts over resources during drought, or the marginal status of someone who violated social taboos. The contrast with later eras would be stark.

## Mission period (1797-1834): A taxonomy of degradation at San Fernando Rey

Mission San Fernando operated as what UCLA historian Benjamin Madley calls "California's First Mass Incarceration System." The absolute bottom was occupied by overlapping categories, each worse than the last.

### The captured runaways

Recaptured escapees faced the *novenario*: **25 lashes per day for nine consecutive days**. Russian hunter Vassili Petrovitch Tarakanoff witnessed: *"They were bound with rawhide ropes, and some were bleeding from wounds, and some children were tied to their mothers."* One chief was sewn into a fresh calf skin and left to die. At Mission San Francisco, friars branded crosses onto escapees' foreheads with hot irons.

**Daily life after recapture:** Working in chains for months or years. Sleeping in stocks. Reduced food rations. Permanent stigma within the mission community. Governor Borica sentenced runaways to two years of shackled labor.

### Women in the monjerío (prison-dormitory)

Governor Diego de Borica described these buildings as *"small, poorly ventilated, and infested"* with *"unbearable stench."* Girls from **age 7 until marriage** were locked inside, along with unmarried women, widows, and women whose husbands were absent.

Chumash testimony documents routine rape: *"When the singing was going on, the priest would have time to select the girl he wanted... The priest had sex with all of them, from the superior all the way down the line."*

### Women who miscarried

Suspected of deliberate abortion, they faced **50 lashes, shackling, and public humiliation**: standing outside the church for nine consecutive days holding a "hideous painted wooden child," sometimes with cattle horns affixed with leather. Their husbands were also shackled and horned.

### Tannery workers

San Fernando's tannery stood **outside the main quadrangle** specifically because of its smell. Workers handled urine (used in tanning) and rotting hides—physically and socially separated from the mission's center, occupying marginal space in both senses.

### Those dying of disease

By 1819, San Fernando reached peak population of **1,080**, then began its decline. Between 1797-1846: 3,188 baptisms versus 2,449 burials. **One in three infants died before their first birthday. Four in ten children died before age five.** The diseased—particularly those with syphilis brought by soldiers who raped Indian women—were isolated and marked.

**The hierarchy from just above:** Alcaldes (Indian officials) were "simple tools of the Franciscans," wielding whips against their own people. Vaqueros and skilled craftsmen occupied positions of relative privilege. Regular field laborers looked down on those in punishment status. The dying were avoided by everyone.

## Mexican rancho period (1834-1848): Debt peons and stolen children

After secularization, approximately 50 Fernandeño leaders received 18,000 acres (only 10% of the Valley). By 1846, these parcels were "aggregated into the Rancho Ex-Mission de San Fernando" when Governor Pico sold the lands. The promises evaporated; what remained was a peonage system.

### The debt-bound laborer

Mission Prefect Duran observed in 1833: *"All in reality are slaves... bound a whole year for an advanced trifle."* Indians received food, clothing, and basic supplies in exchange for labor, becoming permanently indebted. They **"died at twice the rate of southern slaves."**

William Hartnell's 1840 inspection found Indians at Mission Dolores *"all held as slaves and not as voluntary servants."* Eight elderly San Francisco Indians in 1843 described themselves as *"plunged into the very depths of indigence, nakedness and hunger, without property of any kind for their support, far advanced in age, and worn out with a life-time of labor."*

### Captured children

A "virtual slave trade in captured youths from the North Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada emerged during the late 1830s." Augustus Sutter sold Indian children to Hispanic creditors around San Francisco Bay.

Maria Angela Colos remembered: *"She saw a wagon filled with Indian children coming from Martinez. They were bringing them como (like) animals to be bought up by Spanish Californians... They mentioned water as mem, they wanted some water to drink. They were naked."*

Mission San Jose records show **25 Indian "orphans" of non-Christian parents** brought for baptism by prominent families between 1830-1856. At the close of the Mexican Period, "almost every Hispanic household in the San Francisco Bay Area contained Indian servants."

### The matanza workers

The annual slaughter (*la matanza*) employed scores of Indians in the most degrading work. **Tasajoras** (often women) cut meat and gathered fat. **Peladores** stripped hides from carcasses. **Navajadores** killed steers with long knives. The stench of rotting carcasses hung over valleys for days.

**Daily life:** Standard rations of atole (corn porridge) for breakfast, pozole for other meals. Work from sunrise to midday, siesta, then 3pm to sunset. Corporal punishment continued: one man was *"whipped for crying over the death of his wife and child."* Another was *"flogged for clam digging, even though he was seeking to feed his starving family."*

**The view from just above:** Vaqueros earned "very high status and prestige" due to their skills and dangerous work. They lived "a lifestyle more like the gente de razón." Regular laborers looked down on those in debt peonage. Mestizos (Spanish-Indian mix) occupied intermediate positions, distinguishing themselves from "indios."

## Gold Rush and genocide era (1850s-1870s): The Los Angeles slave mart

Between 1850 and 1873, California's Indigenous population plummeted from **150,000 to 30,000**. The Native population of Los Angeles County dropped from 3,693 in 1850 to just **219 by 1870**.

### Legal non-persons

Under California law, Indians could not vote, gain citizenship, or testify against white persons in court. This meant whites could commit any crime—theft, assault, rape, murder—with effective impunity.

### The weekly auction

A de facto slave market operated in downtown Los Angeles from approximately 1850 to 1870:

1. Ranchers paid Indian laborers in **aguardiente** (fortified wine)
2. Indians became intoxicated
3. City marshal arrested them for drunkenness (receiving **$1 kickback per 8 men**)
4. Indians held overnight in an open-air corral
5. Monday mornings: Indians auctioned to ranchers who paid their bail
6. Indians worked one week of forced servitude
7. At week's end, paid in more aguardiente
8. **Repeat—"fifty-two times a year as long as he lived, which did not generally exceed one, two, or three years"** (Horace Bell)

This auction was the city's **second-largest source of municipal revenue**.

### Child indenture

The 1850 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians (an Orwellian name) allowed any white person to declare any Indian "strolling about" a vagrant. The vagrant was sold at public auction. After 1860 amendments, male children could be held until **age 40**, females until **37**. Scholars estimate **at least 20,000 California Indians** were held in bondage between 1850 and 1863, with perhaps **10,000 children** taken under "apprenticeship" provisions.

**Daily survival for Tongva in this period:** Living in hiding, possibly identifying as Mexican-American. Working as day laborers if employment could be found. Risk of arrest for vagrancy if caught unemployed. If arrested, unable to pay fines, sentenced to forced labor. Paid in liquor rather than cash. No legal recourse for any wrong committed by whites.

**The view from just above:** Mexicans and mestizos occupied an intermediate position—diminished from their former elite status but still legally "gente de razón." Some mestizo families protected Indian relatives. Others participated in exploitation, distinguishing themselves from "indios."

## Late 19th century (1870s-1900): Chinese laborers, tramps, and survivors

The Valley transitioned from ranchos to massive wheat farming under Isaac Lankershim and Isaac Van Nuys, who purchased 59,500 acres in 1869. By 1880, their operation was the world's largest wheat-growing empire.

### Chinese workers

Chinese constituted **80% of California agricultural laborers in 1886**. They earned approximately **$1/day** (significantly less than whites), lived in crude bunkhouses or slept under trees, and faced constant threat of violence and expulsion.

The Kern County Californian stated baldly: *"With the Chinese, field hands could be treated like the beasts of the field, and like them be removed by their drivers or herders when no longer needed."*

**The violence:** Chinese were *"murdered with impunity."* In 1893, Chinese were driven from Compton fields and "barricaded in packing sheds where they were forced to sleep for safety." In Redlands, Chinatown was raided, buildings burned, merchants robbed. In 1894, a mob of 40 forced Chinese workers to leave Fullerton.

### The "floating army" of tramps

Large-scale wheat farming required massive seasonal labor. These transient workers—called **bindlestiffs**, fruit tramps, or hoboes—were described by the Los Angeles Times as *"vicious tramps,"* *"miserable,"* and *"Ismaels of Civilization."*

**Daily life:** Sleeping in "tramp camps" along riverbeds, "tramp jungles" on city outskirts, cheap rooming houses, under trees, or in boxcars. Working 16-hour days during harvest; complete unemployment in winter. Police conducted "hobo trapper" sweeps, raiding riverbed camps by tracking campfire light. Any transient venturing into town was likely jailed for vagrancy.

**The chain gang:** Convicted vagrants were sentenced to forced labor—cutting and paving streets (including Sunset Boulevard), digging ditches, building bridges. By 1910, Los Angeles incarcerated more people per capita than any American city.

### Surviving indigenous peoples

Those who survived faced a **convict labor system**. As historian Kelly Lytle Hernández documents: *"Unable to pay fines, they were used as convict laborers in a system of legalized slavery to expand the city of Los Angeles for Anglo-American settlers."*

**The hierarchy of contempt:** Anglo landowners at top viewed all others as inferior. White skilled workers formed anti-Chinese clubs. White transient workers despised Chinese as economic competition. Mexicans occupied intermediate status—above Chinese but below Anglos. Chinese were legally excluded from citizenship and testimony. Indigenous peoples were most marginalized—subjected to actual enslavement through vagrancy laws.

## Early 20th century and aqueduct construction (1900-1920): The expendable

The LA Aqueduct employed thousands of workers under harsh desert conditions from 1908-1913. The workforce was "a tough, hard-drinking mix of nationalities."

### Indigenous (Paiute) workers at the absolute bottom

Archaeological research confirms: *"Indigenous people were relegated to low-wage, unskilled positions and inferior accommodations while working to build the L.A. Aqueduct."* The cruel irony: Paiute workers built infrastructure that would steal water from their own ancestral Owens Valley.

### The "muckers" in the tunnels

Tunnel work was the most dangerous. **142 tunnels totaling 43 miles** were dug by hand and dynamite, some reaching 1,000 feet underground. Workers faced constant risk of cave-ins, working in total darkness, lungs filling with dust.

A **bonus system created deadly pressure**: workers received 40 cents extra per man for each foot beyond the expected 8 feet per day. Elizabeth Tunnel crews set the **world record for hard rock driving: 604 feet in one month**—and the injuries that came with such speed.

**Official death toll:** 43 injury-related deaths recorded, though the "true number may be higher." Causes: cave-ins, dynamite mishaps, equipment failures, falls, rock slides, explosions, vehicle crashes, disease.

### Camp conditions

57 camps along the 233-mile route. Workers lived in sleeping tents with bunks, facing searing heat in summer, freezing temperatures in winter, constant dust storms. Meals cost 25 cents each (deducted from the $2.25 daily wage). When 1,500 Balkan workers left in 1912 for wars in their homelands, they were simply replaced—expendable bodies.

### Japanese "blanket carriers" in the Valley

Called **buranke katsugi** (blanket carriers)—itinerant workers carrying belongings in blankets as they moved between jobs. Japanese diary farmers "awoke at 3 a.m. and worked until 9 p.m. every day without holidays." Despite discrimination, Japanese farming families demonstrated such skill that white agricultural advisors told farmers to adopt their methods—which bred envy and resentment, leading to the LA Times encouraging consumers to boycott Asian-American produce.

---

## Depression era (1930s): Terror, displacement, and hierarchy among the desperate

### Mexican Repatriation: The most complete destruction

**1 million to 1.8 million** people of Mexican descent were forced from the United States between 1929-1939. **60% were U.S. citizens** (American-born children of immigrants). One-third of Los Angeles's Mexican population (~35,000 people) was "repatriated" between 1929-1936.

**The terror:** Raids took the form of "full-scale paramilitary operations." In 1931, over 400 people were rounded up at La Placita Park in a single raid. The LA County Welfare Department deported hospital patients—a woman with leprosy was driven to the border and "left in Mexicali." Mentally ill patients were forced into repatriation. Gravely ill patients sometimes died before reaching Mexico.

**The deportation trains:** Families loaded like cattle into boxcars. Men were "quiet and pensive" while "women and children cried." Older children begged their parents to stay. Families were "forced to abandon, or were defrauded of, personal and real property."

**The lasting shame:** "Few of them ever told their children about their tragic ordeal."

### Dust Bowl migrants: The despised replacements

The Library of Congress holds Dorothea Lange's 1935 photograph titled **"Oklahoma dust bowl refugees. San Fernando, California"**—proving Okies arrived directly in the Valley.

**The names they were called:** "Okies," "Hillbillies," "Fruit tramps," "Maggie" or "maggot" (children at school). A California businessman described them as *"ignorant, filthy people"* who *"shouldn't think they're as good as the next man."* A service station worker: *"Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do."*

**Living conditions:** Families reduced to "roadside squatters' camps" or "ditchbank camps" next to irrigation ditches. Homes built from packing crates, tin, cardboard. Children barefoot, "dressed in rags." Tuberculosis spread; child mortality was high.

**The LAPD "bum blockade":** In February 1936, Police Chief James Davis dispatched 150 officers to the California-Arizona border with 16 checkpoints to turn back migrants with "no visible means of support."

### The hierarchy of Depression-era desperation

The Mexican deportees suffered the most complete destruction—losing not just homes and livelihoods but citizenship, country, and identity. American-born children who didn't speak Spanish arrived in Mexico to face rejection. The Okies' suffering was severe but temporary—by 1940, defense jobs offered escape. For the deported, there was often no return.

**Who looked down on whom:** Established Californians viewed all migrants (Mexican, Filipino, Okie) as threatening disease-carriers. Okies, despite their desperation, viewed Mexican and Asian workers as beneath them—evidenced by willingness to cross picket lines. Before the Depression, 20% of migrant workers were white; by 1936, 85% were white. Okies took jobs from Mexican and Filipino workers by working for less and not joining unions.

## WWII and Japanese internment (1940s): The cascading displacements

### The Valley's Japanese American community

**3,177 to 3,200 Japanese Americans** lived in the San Fernando Valley on the eve of internment, primarily in Pacoima and San Fernando. Japanese farmers were responsible for **40% of California's vegetables**, including nearly 100% of tomatoes, celery, strawberries, and peppers.

### What they lost

Anyone with **as little as 1/16th Japanese blood** was subject to incarceration. Families given only days to dispose of everything. Could bring only what they could carry.

Austin Anson, managing secretary of the Grower-Shipper Vegetable Association, stated openly: *"We're charged with wanting to get rid of the Japs for selfish reasons. We might as well be honest. We do... And we do not want them back when the war ends, either."*

**Total property loss:** estimated **$400 million** ($1.3 billion in lost property + $2.7 billion in lost income). Japanese American farms were sold for pennies on the dollar—Yoshimi Matsuura's family forced to sell vineyards for **$23 per acre** instead of the $200 market value. White farmers eagerly absorbed the properties.

### Returning to terrorism

Each person released received only **$25 and a one-way ticket**. What awaited them: **70 instances of terrorism and 19-20 shootings** documented in the first year. Gunshots fired into homes, arson, threats, vandalism. "No Japs Wanted" signs common.

**Where returnees lived:** Federal trailer installations in Burbank. Single rooms in Valley homes as compensation for domestic work. Trailer parks in Sun Valley that didn't close until 1956. **75% of Japanese American returnees** lived in crowded hostels, churches, temples, and hotels near Skid Row. Only 25% had property to return to.

### The Zoot Suit Riots (June 1943)

U.S. servicemen and white civilians attacked Mexican American youth wearing zoot suits. **Thousands of servicemen** marched through downtown LA with clubs. Youth as young as **12 years old** were dragged from movie theaters and diners, stripped of clothing, beaten.

Police arrested **hundreds of Mexican American victims** rather than white attackers. Mexican American boys requested to be arrested for protection: *"Charge me with vagrancy or anything, but don't send me out there!"*

### The cascading hierarchy

African Americans migrating for defense jobs moved into vacated Little Tokyo, renaming it "Bronzeville" (1942-1945). When Japanese Americans returned, white building owners preferred Japanese tenants. Landlords structured leases to encourage Japanese renters. Japanese organizations sometimes sued Black business owners for property. Urban renewal in 1950 destroyed 1/4 of the neighborhood—3,000 evicted, 90% Black.

---

## Postwar white flight era (1950s-1960s): The architecture of exclusion

By the 1940s, **95% of Los Angeles and Southern California housing was off-limits to certain minorities** through racially restrictive covenants. **Pacoima became the only neighborhood to accept people of color in the entire Valley.**

### The texture of rejection

Preston Morris, a **Lockheed Martin research engineer with a Master's degree from Howard University**, found his efforts to purchase a Valley home "continually blunted." In 1960, he told federal officials: *"Most of my encounters in the Valley have not been [met] with success. We are still looking."*

Marguerite Herrick of North Hollywood stated openly: *"Do they want to live next to colored people?... We don't have any grievances to the colored people, but let's just keep them out of the Valley."*

### Terror against Black homebuyers

When government worker **Emory Holmes** purchased a new home in Pacoima's white section: crank calls to pool installers and insurance salesmen in his name; broken windows, tacks in the driveway, and graffiti: **"Black cancer here. Don't let it spread!"** The white man who sold his home to the Holmes was fired from his aerospace engineering job.

**The O'Day Short family tragedy (Fontana, 1945):** O'Day Short, a refrigeration engineer, bought land in an all-white area. Sheriff's deputies visited to "advise" him. The Chamber of Commerce offered to buy it back. He was warned about "the vigilante committee." On December 16, 1945, the home exploded. **Helen Short and children Barry (9) and Carol Ann (7) died from burns.** O'Day lingered for a month, then died after the DA informed him his family had perished. No one was ever charged.

Between 1950-1959: **six bombings and four incidents of arson** against Black homeowners in LA County. **17% of housing incidents** occurred in the San Fernando Valley, mostly in working-class Canoga Park.

### Sundown towns surrounding the Valley

**Glendale:** A notorious sundown town where any nonwhite seen after sunset was picked up by police and either charged or taken to the city line. In 2020, Glendale's City Council released an apology.

**Burbank:** Had an "old ordinance... which prohibited Negroes from remaining inside municipal limits after sun down."

### The freeway through minority neighborhoods

**21,011 people were displaced in East Los Angeles** by freeway construction—"probably the largest per capita displacement in California history." After **three different freeways through Pacoima** in the 1960s-70s, residents faced disproportionate environmental and health disadvantages. **Over 1,500 properties** were taken by the Simi Freeway alone. Wealthier white neighborhoods to the west were listened to by planners and spared. Black residents were **excluded from the public route decision-making process.**

---

## 1970s-1980s Valley: Day laborers, porn performers, and the deindustrialized

### Day laborers (esquineros)

By the late 1980s, approximately **3,000 day laborers** gathered in LA; by the late 1990s, **20,000**. Overwhelmingly male, non-English-speaking migrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras.

**The daily ritual:** Arrived as early as 6:00 a.m., waited until 3:00 p.m. Stood in clusters making eye contact with passing drivers. When an employer stopped, workers **swarmed the vehicle** fighting to be chosen. The employer pointed: "Tú... Tú... Tú..." On good days, 22 men hired out of 60-70 waiting.

**Dangers:** Wage theft (25% earned below minimum wage). Dangerous work without training. Constant fear of "la Migra." Police harassment. One worker took three buses daily from Boyle Heights, spending $3.10 each way.

**The hierarchy among them:** Workers with "regular" employers had higher status. Experienced *veteranos* mentored newcomers. *Borrachitos* (drunks) were marginalized for damaging the corner's reputation.

### The porn industry's bottom rung

The Valley produced **90% of American pornography** at its peak. 10,000-20,000 employed yearly; $4 billion annual sales in the 1990s.

**At the absolute bottom:** Linda Lovelace received only **$1,250 for Deep Throat** while producers made millions. She later revealed she was "beaten severely to force her to perform sex acts" and coerced by her husband/manager. The VHS revolution lowered barriers to entry—crews shrank, budgets collapsed, "art largely went by the wayside." Anyone with a camera could exploit performers.

### GM Van Nuys: The loss of good jobs

The plant operated 1947-1992, producing 6.3 million vehicles. At peak: 5,100 workers, **$17/hour** (~$35 in 2022 dollars), unionized, with benefits and pensions. Workforce: 50% Latino, 15% Black, 15% women.

**August 27, 1992:** The final red Camaro Z-28 rolled off the line. 2,600 workers displaced. The plant sat vacant until 1998, then became a shopping center: Home Depot, Babies 'R' Us, Starbucks. **Critical shift:** From unionized $17/hour jobs with benefits to low-wage, part-time retail jobs with nothing. "Few employees at the Plant could afford a home in the Valley, or even a small apartment, on the wages they receive."

---

## 1990s Rodney King era: Institutional and street-level contempt

The Rodney King beating occurred **in the Valley itself**—Lake View Terrace, near Hansen Dam—on March 3, 1991. When the acquittal came on April 29, 1992, **200-400 protesters gathered at the beating site**. Violence spread to Pacoima and surrounding neighborhoods.

### Institutionally despised: Undocumented immigrants

**Proposition 187 (1994)** expressed Valley contempt for immigrants—seeking to deny public services, education, and healthcare to the undocumented, and requiring teachers and healthcare workers to report suspected undocumented people. It passed with 59% statewide support.

Glenn Spencer of Sherman Oaks hung a California flag upside down in protest against immigration. After the Northridge earthquake, parks in the west Valley "turned into tent cities for thousands of immigrants displaced from quake-shattered apartments"—visible evidence that inflamed tensions.

### Street-level despised: Gang members

The Valley had serious gang activity:
- **Vineland Boys** (founded 1988): Approximately 300 members, described by federal indictment as "one of the most violent street gangs in the San Fernando Valley"
- **Pacoima 13**: Dating to the 1950s
- **SFV Peckerwoods**: White supremacist gang allied with Aryan Brotherhood

**Pacoima in 1994:** The poorest area in the Valley. Poverty rate between 25% and 40%. One in three residents in public housing. A **143-day consecutive period without drive-by shootings** was celebrated as a major victory.

### The intersection of contempt

A young undocumented Latino man in a gang in Pacoima occupied the absolute bottom—despised by white residents, hunted by CRASH units, targeted by rival gangs, invisible to earthquake relief, and potentially deportable at any moment.

---

## Post-9/11 era (2001-2010s): New targets, overlapping surveillance

### The Valley's Middle Eastern communities

The San Fernando Valley hosts significant Iranian (Encino, Tarzana, Woodland Hills), Armenian (North Hollywood, Valley Glen, Van Nuys), and Arab American populations. **50% of Iranians in LA County live in the Valley.**

### The surge in hate crimes

**LA County hate crimes against Middle Easterners: 12 in 2000 → 188 in 2001** (15x increase). FBI reported a **17-fold increase** in anti-Muslim crimes nationwide.

**Surinder Singh Sodi:** Beaten with metal poles by two men in his Los Angeles store on December 12, 2001; attackers accused him of being Osama bin Laden.

### Sikhs mistaken for Muslims

The **first hate crime murder after 9/11:** Balbir Singh Sodhi, shot September 15, 2001 by a man who wanted to "shoot some towel-heads." Sikh Coalition documented **300+ cases of violence** in the first month. A 2013 survey found **70% of Americans could not identify a Sikh** in a picture.

**Daily life:** Some Sikhs asked by family to cut hair and stop wearing turbans. Elderly Sikhs particularly targeted. Gas station owners, cab drivers faced heightened danger. Some temple-goers concealed indicators of their religion.

### Muslim daily experience

- **25% reported verbal assaults**
- **19% reported physical assaults**
- **19% reported unprovoked interrogation by government agents**
- **82%+ felt unsafe to extremely unsafe** after 9/11
- **80,000+ Muslim immigrants** called in for questioning

**Daily textures:** American flags suddenly appearing on homes in Middle Eastern neighborhoods. Turbans tucked under baseball caps. Beards shaved. Hijabs worn differently or removed. Parents telling children not to speak Arabic in public.

### Intersection with anti-Latino enforcement

The creation of DHS and ICE in 2003 merged anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement. Border security funding doubled. **Operation Return to Sender** (2006-2007): 23,000+ unauthorized immigrants arrested nationally. January 2007: Raids in LA Metro area netted **338 immigrants at homes/apartments**.

Both Middle Eastern and Latino communities experienced: racial profiling, workplace vulnerability, fear of reporting discrimination, and "othering" rhetoric (Muslims as terrorists; Latinos as "illegals").

## Present day (2020s): The taxonomy of contemporary despair

### The homeless

**10,701 unhoused persons** counted in the San Fernando Valley (2024). Major concentrations along Balboa Boulevard, Sepulveda Boulevard, under freeway overpasses, in industrial areas.

**Daily traumas:** Regular sweeps force packing belongings into shopping carts, moving briefly, then returning. **Municipal Code 41.18** arrests can result in $2,500 fines and 6 weeks jail. In a 2022 survey of homeless women: 57.9% experienced theft, 43.1% were repeatedly threatened, 35.3% were physically attacked, 20.4% were coerced into unwanted sexual activity.

Homeless are **19x more likely to be murdered, 27x more likely to face attempted murder** than housed population.

### Undocumented immigrants under ICE

**Approximately 900,000-1 million undocumented immigrants** in LA County. The San Fernando Valley has the **highest concentration** of ICE operations according to CHIRLA heat maps. **2,205 arrests in LA area** in June 2025 alone.

**Daily life in fear:** Many refuse to leave homes—entire neighborhoods have become "ghost towns." Parents send citizen children to do grocery shopping. Using Waze app to track law enforcement. Some families **starving** rather than risk stores. Business down **70%** in immigrant areas.

### Trans women of color

Black transgender women are especially vulnerable. **86%** of trans women who have contacted police report harassment, attacks, or mistreatment. **1 in 5 transgender adults** have participated in sex work. Of 53 transgender murders 2013-2015, **34%** were in the sex trade.

**Daily dangers:** Police "determining their gender" through groping. Accused of having "fake" identity documents. If arrested, often sent to **male prisons**. The "whorearchy"—internal hierarchy where white cisgender sex workers have more safety than trans women of color.

### Day laborers under renewed threat

Estimated **4,000 day laborers** in the Valley gather at Home Depot parking lots and corners. **ICE raids now target these sites directly.**

The bizarre dangers: In 2023, day laborers in Tarzana were hired to dispose of trash bags that turned out to contain **dismembered human body parts**. Workers have been blindfolded to care for marijuana plantations, then arrested as operators.

### The hierarchy today

**The absolute bottom** includes overlapping populations: homeless trans women of color (facing violence from multiple directions), undocumented day laborers (constant fear of ICE, wage theft, dangerous jobs), sex trafficking victims (complete loss of autonomy), homeless individuals with severe mental illness/addiction (trapped in cycles of arrest and release), and homeless LGBTQ+ youth (rejected by families, surviving through sex work, preyed upon by traffickers).

**What they share:** Invisibility, expendability, fear of authority figures who should protect them, daily humiliations, and an almost complete absence of recourse when violated.

## Synthesis for your Watcher character

Your Watcher, with an ambiguous Middle Eastern appearance, would be read differently across these eras:

- **Pre-contact:** Possibly as a stranger from another village, subject to hospitality norms
- **Mission/Rancho period:** Possibly as a mestizo or "gente de razón"—intermediate status
- **Gold Rush era:** Possibly as Mexican, subject to intermediate discrimination
- **Late 19th century:** Possibly as a "swarthy" immigrant—Italian, Greek, or "oriental"
- **Early 20th century:** As one of the Balkan laborers on the aqueduct
- **Depression era:** As Mexican, subject to deportation terror
- **WWII:** Possibly as Mexican, facing Zoot Suit violence
- **1950s-60s:** Subject to housing discrimination in some areas
- **1970s-80s:** As Middle Eastern immigrant during Iranian hostage crisis
- **1990s:** As ambiguously Latino, subject to Prop 187 sentiment
- **Post-9/11:** As specifically Muslim/Arab, subject to surveillance and violence
- **Present:** As Middle Eastern, facing ICE assumptions or anti-Muslim sentiment

The constant across all eras: those at the bottom are **legally invisible** (cannot testify, cannot complain, cannot access protection), **economically expendable** (replaceable, underpaid, disposable), and **socially despised** by those just above them in the hierarchy, who need someone to look down on.

The Watcher would observe that the categories shift—Indian to Chinese to Japanese to Mexican to Black to Muslim—but the structure remains: someone must occupy the position of the despised, the one whom even other marginalized people fear becoming.
