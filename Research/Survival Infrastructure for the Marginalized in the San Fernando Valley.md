An immortal being imprisoned in the San Fernando Valley—one who cannot lie, doesn't need food, appears ambiguously Middle Eastern, and yearns to both teach and learn—would find dramatically different survival options across the centuries. This research maps the refuges, libraries, charitable organizations, and community structures that could shelter such a person while allowing them to contribute meaningfully without deception.

## The mission period (1797-1834): Limited options beyond ecclesiastical control

**Avoiding the missions was possible, but difficult.** Mission San Fernando, founded September 8, 1797, absorbed virtually all indigenous peoples within a 30-mile radius within a decade. By 1819, its neophyte population peaked at 1,081. However, several escape routes existed.

Interior tribes in the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills provided refuge for "fugitives"—between 1769 and 1817, **473 documented cases** of Indians fleeing Mission San Gabriel alone show that flight was common. After 1810, increasing numbers formed "conglomerate tribes" that resisted Mexican authority. The mountains offered sanctuary: many Chumash fled into remote areas after the 1824 revolt at three Santa Barbara-area missions.

**For writing materials, the options were severely constrained.** Franciscan priests possessed nearly all paper, ink, and quill pens—the Mission Santa Barbara archive remains the oldest library in California still held by its original founders. Military officers, presidio commanders, and the alcalde in the Pueblo de Los Angeles (founded 1781 as a secular settlement) had limited supplies. A literate person could potentially work as a scribe for visiting hide-and-tallow traders, who began arriving regularly and needed correspondence handled.

**Roles available without documentation included:** vaquero (cowhand) on Francisco Reyes' rancho (which predated Mission San Fernando), domestic servant, laborer processing hides and tallow, craftsperson (tanning, weaving, ironwork—skills taught at missions but practicable elsewhere), agricultural worker, or messenger/guide where trail knowledge was valuable.

## Mexican/Rancho period (1834-1848): Charity collapses, opportunity emerges

The **Mexican Secularization Act of 1833** dismantled the mission system beginning August 9, 1834. Mission buildings were stripped; most priests returned to Mexico. The last Franciscan at San Fernando, Fray Blas Ordaz, remained until June 30, 1847. Organized charity essentially **ceased to exist**—it became a "family matter."

The rancho system offered informal employment without paperwork. Workers received housing, food, and clothing rather than wages, bound in perpetual peonage with "few alternatives." No formal employment records were required. Indigenous peoples provided most labor: herding cattle, processing tallow, tending gardens. "Spanish-speaking natives intermarried with working-class Mexicans, blurring already complicated racial categories"—an ambiguously Middle Eastern person might navigate this fluidity.

**Literacy resources remained scarce.** The first general stores (Temple and Rice, 1827) carried basic writing supplies. Wealthy Californio families had private book collections. Visiting merchants brought printed materials.

A remarkable development: in 1843-1845, approximately 50 surviving Fernandeño leaders negotiated land grants totaling over **18,000 acres** (10% of the San Fernando Valley), including Rancho El Escorpion and Rancho Encino. In 1843, Samuel, a Tataviam man, received a 1,000-vara tract. These indigenous-held lands offered alternative community structures until the American conquest.

## Gold Rush and genocide era (1850s-1870s): Violence and the first formal charities

California's genocide of indigenous peoples killed between **9,492 and 16,094** Native people between 1846-1873. Governor Burnett declared in 1851 that "a war of extermination will continue to be waged." Los Angeles operated "a de facto slave mart for Native Americans" using vagrancy laws. Someone appearing foreign would need to navigate extreme danger carefully.

**The first formal charitable organizations emerged:**

The **Daughters of Charity arrived January 5, 1856**—seven sisters who became "the key provider of social service in Los Angeles before 1880." They opened the Los Angeles Orphan Asylum (1858) and Southern California's first hospital (1858), serving anyone regardless of religion. During smallpox epidemics, they advocated for the poor.

**Biddy Mason**, formerly enslaved, won her freedom through the courts (1856)—she couldn't lie about her circumstances and didn't have to. In 1869, she founded the First African Methodist Episcopal Church with Charles Owens. Her story provides a model: honest testimony, community building, and philanthropy.

The **Hebrew Benevolent Society (mid-1850s)** became Los Angeles' first chartered charity. President Henry Wartenberg stated in 1870: "The only thing taken into consideration was whether they were worthy of receiving assistance or not... it made no difference whether the applicant were Jew or gentile." This tradition of serving all faiths without requiring conversion would persist.

**The first public library** came late: the Los Angeles Library Association was founded in late 1872, opening a "well-stocked reading room" in the Downey Block at Temple and Main Streets in early 1873.

**Available roles:** domestic servant, laundry worker, street vendor, day laborer, craftsperson, nurse/midwife (as Biddy Mason was), ranch hand.

## Late 19th century (1870s-1900): Settlement houses transform social service

**No synagogues existed in the San Fernando Valley during this era**—the Valley remained agricultural with minimal settlement. In greater Los Angeles, Congregation B'nai B'rith (now Wilshire Boulevard Temple) was chartered in **1862** as the first synagogue, with its first building constructed in 1873.

The settlement house movement brought transformative resources:

**Casa de Castelar (1894)** became the **first settlement house west of the Mississippi**, founded after Jane Addams visited Los Angeles. Located in Sonoratown near the Plaza, it served "the Spanish-Mexican of every degree and calling... the Italian frescoer and sculptor, the Frenchman, German and the Assyrian." This explicit inclusion of Assyrians (Middle Eastern immigrants) shows such a person could find acceptance. Casa de Castelar opened a **Los Angeles Public Library deposit station in 1897** and offered industrial classes, lectures, kindergarten, and sewing clubs.

**Brownson Settlement House (1901)**, a Catholic settlement led by Mary Julia Workman, served the Mexican community with a library offering reading groups in English and Spanish.

The first **Carnegie libraries** in Los Angeles came with a grant of **$210,000 on January 31, 1911**—six branches built 1913-1916. However, **no Carnegie libraries were ever built in the San Fernando Valley** due to its sparse agricultural population.

For your character: settlement house volunteer or resident worker roles didn't require formal documentation. A literate person could serve as scribe or clerk for merchants, library assistant, religious teacher, or craftsperson. The Jewish community accepted merchants and peddlers who started as itinerant salesmen.

## Early 20th century (1900-1930): The Valley awakens

The Valley transformed after the 1913 LA Aqueduct brought water, converting wheat and sheep farms to citrus orchards. Available work exploded: citrus farming, walnut orchards, packinghouse labor, canning, railroad construction, and by the 1920s, motion pictures (Warner Bros and Universal established facilities).

**The first public library in the San Fernando Valley**—the San Fernando Library—opened in **November 1914** as a branch of the LA County Free Library, initially in the Industrial Arts building of San Fernando Union High School. In its first year, 1,849 books circulated to 156 borrowers.

**Jewish settlement in the Valley remained minimal before 1930.** In 1914, Alex Ratner purchased 45 acres in Sun Valley—among the earliest Jewish settlers. The Ratners traveled weekly to Temple Street in LA for kosher supplies and Shabbat services. The first attempt to build a Valley synagogue in 1928 failed due to the Depression.

**Ethnic mutual aid societies flourished:**
- **Mexican mutualistas** (from 1918) provided housing assistance, healthcare, sickness/burial insurance, loans, legal aid, libraries, and adult education
- **Japanese kenjinkai** (prefectural associations, from 1899) offered funeral coordination, mutual aid, and hiring networks
- **Armenian organizations** began forming in the 1920s, including the Varoujan Club (1924)

**Jewish charitable infrastructure expanded dramatically:**
- Hebrew Sheltering Association (1908) became Jewish Home for the Aged
- Vista del Mar/Jewish Orphans Home (1906)
- Kaspare Cohn Hospital (1902) became Cedars-Sinai
- Jewish Consumptive Relief Association (1906/1912) became City of Hope
- Federation of Jewish Charities (1912)

For your character, the 1900-1930 era offered the greatest opportunity yet. Settlement house work remained available. **Armenian immigrants arrived from 1900**, many fleeing the Hamidian massacres (1894-1896)—known as rug merchants, they settled in working-class areas. Someone appearing Middle Eastern could plausibly integrate with this community. The **Sephardic Jewish community** also grew, with Avat Shalom Congregation founded in 1912 by families with Levantine surnames (Zeitoun, Bramy, Caraco).

## Depression era (1930s): Crisis reveals both danger and solidarity

**New Deal programs in the Valley included:**
- WPA Project No. 645: The **Balboa Avenue Improvement**, a 9.8-mile farm-to-market road connecting San Fernando Road to Ventura Boulevard
- PWA funded approximately **$34.7 million** in school reconstruction after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
- WPA pay scales (1935): unskilled $55/month, skilled $85/month, professional $94/month

**Major soup kitchens:**
- **Union Rescue Mission** (founded 1891, at 226 South Main from 1926) supplied **42% of all free meals** provided by private charities in LA during the Depression
- **The Midnight Mission** (founded 1914) was designated "California Emergency Relief Station No. 1"—the only facility able to handle the scale of human tragedy
- **Aimee Semple McPherson** personally served the hungry at her soup kitchen

**The Mexican Repatriation (1929-1939)** posed extreme danger. Between 300,000 and 2 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were deported, **40-60% of them U.S. citizens**. The La Placita Park Raid (1931) rounded up over 400 people. Someone who couldn't lie about their status faced grave risk.

**Survival strategies for the undocumented:**
- Stay out of public spaces and avoid relief agencies (which checked citizenship)
- **Agricultural growers sometimes protected workers** they needed—opposing deportations
- **La Opinión** newspaper published warnings about upcoming raids
- **Self-help cooperatives** emerged: "primitive but heroic efforts to maintain themselves by salvaging surplus vegetables, cutting wood, and bartering labor for food." Congress eventually authorized grants to these cooperatives.

The **San Fernando Library continued operating** through the Depression from storefront locations on North Maclay Street. The LA Public Library expanded services: more seating installed, Reference Desk fielded 80 questions per hour, want-ads were in such demand they were handed out separately, and circulation of self-help books increased.

**Labor organizing offered community and protection:**
- The Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union led 24 strikes involving 37,500 workers in 1933
- **El Congreso** (National Congress of Spanish-Speaking Peoples, 1938), founded by Luisa Moreno, linked labor rights to civil rights
- These organizations welcomed marginalized workers and organized across racial lines

## WWII era (1940s): Quakers emerge as crucial allies

**The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)** became one of the few organizations that **actively opposed Japanese American incarceration:**

**Before internment:** Conducted letter-writing campaigns, helped families sell or store belongings, found temporary lodging, visited homes for moral support.

**During internment:** Visited camps bringing food, clothing, recreational materials, and reading materials. Most crucially, the AFSC led the **National Japanese American Student Relocation Council (NJASRC)**, which helped **over 4,000 Japanese American students** transfer to colleges outside the exclusion zone.

**After the war:** Established **hostels in Pasadena and Los Angeles** to help returnees. Esther Takei Nishio was the first Japanese American student to return to the West Coast with AFSC assistance.

**For conscientious objectors:** The Civilian Public Service (CPS) program, run by Quakers, Mennonites, and Brethren, employed approximately 12,000 draftees in "work of national importance." CPS Camp 115.2 at USC conducted altitude pressure experiments; Camp #76 at Tanbark Flat offered forest service work. CPS workers served without wages, supported by their churches and families—and faced daily harassment as "yellow bellies."

**Housing resources:**
- **Rodger Young Village** in Griffith Park: 750 Quonset huts housing 1,500+ families (5,000 residents at peak), dedicated April 1946 for returning veterans
- **Federal trailer installations** housed some Japanese Americans returning from camps
- The Housing Authority of Los Angeles had built 10 public housing projects pre-war, with more during the war (including Jordan Downs, which opened May 1944)

**The San Fernando Valley's Tuna Canyon Detention Station** held over 1,000 Japanese Americans—primarily men whose community leadership positions (Buddhist priests, language school teachers) made them suspect. This is now the Verdugo Hills Golf Course.

**Defense industry work** dominated the Valley: Lockheed in Burbank employed **over 90,000 workers** for wartime production. The factory was famously camouflaged by Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros artists with fake suburban homes and burlap bungalows.

**For your character:** The Quaker emphasis on "that of God in everyone" required no conversion and welcomed anyone committed to service. AFSC hostel work, CPS service (if somehow drafted), or religious organization volunteer work offered community without documentation requirements.

## Postwar era (1950s-1960s): Civil rights and the fight against covenants

**Racial covenants blanketed the San Fernando Valley**—by the 1960s, affluent suburbs remained 95-100% white. In 1927, the Los Angeles Real Estate Board had recommended covenants; chambers of commerce coordinated "drives to blanket neighborhoods." Despite Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), segregation continued through banker and realtor discrimination.

**Pacoima became the only neighborhood that accepted people of color.** African Americans, Mexican Americans, Japanese Americans, and Filipino Americans crafted a unique community there, "interacting in markets, on farms, and in schools." In a Pacoima garage in the late 1950s, multiracial youth formed the rock and roll group "the Silhouettes"—including Richard Valenzuela (Ritchie Valens).

**Civil rights organizations:**
- **San Fernando Valley NAACP Chapter** centered in Pacoima, working with multi-faith and multi-racial fair housing councils
- **ACLU Valley Chapter** enlisted volunteer attorneys after student demonstrations at San Fernando Valley State College (now CSUN)
- **Calvary Baptist Church of Pacoima** (founded 1955 by Rev. Hillery T. and Rosa L. Broadous) became a central institution—now designated a Los Angeles Historic District

**Library expansion:**
- The **1957 bond issue** ($6.4 million) funded **14 projects in the San Fernando Valley**—the first bond since 1925
- **Pacoima Branch** opened August 26, 1961
- **Van Nuys Branch** opened May 11, 1964, becoming bookmobile headquarters
- Libraries served diverse populations with multilingual collections (Russian, Yiddish, German, French, Polish, Spanish)

**Jewish settlement finally took root:**
- **1938**: Valley Jewish Community Center founded (later Adat Ari El)—first organized Jewish institution in the Valley
- **1946**: Temple Beth Hillel founded—first Reform synagogue in the Valley
- **1949**: The David Familian Chapel at Adat Ari El dedicated—**first structure built specifically as a synagogue in the Valley** (California Point of Historical Interest)
- **1950**: Valley Beth Shalom founded in Encino
- **1952**: Temple Judea founded in Tarzana

**Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles** established a Valley branch office in the 1950s, extending services on a non-sectarian basis.

## 1970s-1990s: Sanctuary movement and immigrant aid infrastructure

**The Sanctuary Movement transformed churches into refuges:**

**La Placita Church** (Our Lady Queen of the Angels) became the heart of LA's sanctuary movement. Pastor Father Luis Olivares declared it a sanctuary church on **December 12, 1985**. The church fed, clothed, and housed refugees; allowed hundreds to sleep in pews; provided medical and legal assistance; helped with jobs and school enrollment. In 1987, it became the **first sanctuary to extend protection to undocumented Mexican immigrants**. Immigration officials never entered despite threats.

**At its peak, the Sanctuary Movement involved over 500 congregations nationally**, including Lutherans, United Church of Christ, Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, Jews, Unitarian Universalists, and Quakers. Los Angeles became the **first city to pass a sanctuary policy (1979)**, when the LAPD's **Special Order 40** prohibited police from initiating action to discover immigration status.

**Major immigrant aid organizations founded during this era:**

**El Rescate (1981)** became the first agency in the U.S. to respond with free legal and social services to Central American refugees. It established the **Clínica Monsignor Óscar Romero** (1983) for free medical/dental care, a Human Rights Department (1984), and **El Refugio** (1987) for temporary housing. It has served over 500,000 people representing 38 nationalities.

**CARECEN (Central American Resource Center, 1983)** was founded by Salvadoran refugees and became the largest Central American organization in the country. Its **San Fernando Valley office** is located at 16501 Sherman Way, Suite 220, Van Nuys. In 2004, it founded a Day Labor Center.

**CHIRLA (Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, 1986)** was founded by Father Luis Olivares and representatives from CARECEN, Asian Pacific American Legal Center, and Dolores Mission. It advocated for day laborer centers, leading to the Harbor City Job Center (1989).

**Day laborer centers emerged:** The City of Los Angeles established one of the first hiring sites in Southern California at **Harbor City Regional Park (1989)**. The **National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON)** was officially founded in **July 2001 in Northridge, California**.

**Adult literacy programs expanded:**
- **1984**: LAPL launched adult literacy programs in partnership with California State Library
- Walk-in tutoring became available at Valley branches including West Valley Regional, Mid-Valley Regional, Valley Plaza, and Platt Branch
- **Cultural Resource Centers** opened: Chicano Resource Center at East Los Angeles Library (1976), Black Resource Center at A.C. Bilbrew Library (1978)

**Mid-Valley Regional Branch Library** opened **March 15, 1996** as the **largest LAPL branch at 27,981 square feet**—approved in 1962 but taking 34 years to complete.

For your character, this era offered unprecedented infrastructure. Organizations like El Rescate, CARECEN, and sanctuary churches **explicitly welcomed people regardless of documentation status**. Day labor centers provided work without paperwork. Libraries offered literacy programs and writing materials to anyone. Teaching ESL at a day labor center would be an ideal role for someone who wants to help while remaining honest about their circumstances.

## Present day: A network of mutual aid and accessible services

**Homeless services (for someone who doesn't need food but needs shelter and community):**

**Hope the Mission** (formerly Hope of the Valley Rescue Mission) operates the **NoHo Shelter** (15,000 sq ft, 85 beds) in North Hollywood, offering computer learning centers, case management, housing navigation, mental health services, and substance abuse counseling.

### San Fernando Valley synagogue timeline

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1862 | First LA synagogue (Congregation B'nai B'rith, now Wilshire Boulevard Temple) |
| 1938 | **Valley Jewish Community Center founded (later Adat Ari El)**—first organized Jewish institution in the Valley |

**Jewish law (tzedakah) mandates serving non-Jews "with" Jews for "ways of peace" (mipnei darchei shalom).** The Hebrew Benevolent Society, founded in 1854, explicitly served "destitute Jews and Gentiles." Maimonides' eight levels of tzedakah prioritize enabling self-sufficiency—giving someone a job or partnership ranks highest.

### Quaker organizations in Los Angeles

**AFSC Pacific Southwest Regional Office**: 5472 Crenshaw Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90043

**Orange Grove Monthly Meeting** (Pasadena) was established with a meeting house built 1907-1908. **Pacific Yearly Meeting** was founded in 1947. The **Conejo Valley Worship Group** (Thousand Oaks) is the closest meeting to the western San Fernando Valley.

**Quaker tradition of aid without conversion:** Based on "that of God in everyone"—the Inner Light present in all regardless of race, religion, or background. AFSC explicitly states work is "based on the Quaker belief in the dignity and worth of every person." **No conversion requirement exists.** Historically, Quakers fed German children after WWI (former enemies), helped both sides in the Spanish Civil War, and assisted non-religious Jews escape Nazi Germany.

### Catholic Worker movement in Los Angeles

**LA Catholic Worker (founded 1970):**
- **Ammon Hennacy House of Hospitality**: 632 North Brittania Street, Los Angeles (Boyle Heights)
- **Hospitality Kitchen ("Hippie Kitchen")**: 821 E. 6th Street (Skid Row)—serves over 3,000 hot meals weekly

**Critical for your character:** The LA Catholic Worker **"does not proselytize to its clients."** Their statement: **"If you come to our kitchen, you will get food no matter who you are."** The organization is deliberately non-institutional, not a 501(c)(3), and accepts no government funding. Prayer is available but not required for those receiving services.

### Catholic Charities of Los Angeles

**Founded 1919**, now operates 22 community centers and 7 homeless shelters. **Glendale office** (4322 San Fernando Road) is accessible to Valley residents and offers services in English, Arabic, Farsi, and Armenian. **Recipients do NOT need to be Catholic.**

## Conclusion: The Valley's evolving refuge architecture

The San Fernando Valley's survival infrastructure follows a clear arc: from the coercive mission system to rancho informality, through brutal genocide and the emergence of formal charity, into settlement houses and ethnic mutual aid, through Depression-era crisis and wartime Quaker resistance, and finally into the sanctuary movement and present-day mutual aid networks.

**For an immortal being with your character's constraints, the most hospitable eras would be:** the settlement house period (1894-1930s) when multicultural social service flourished; the postwar library expansion (1957-1970s) when Valley branches multiplied; and the sanctuary era (1980s-present) when explicit infrastructure emerged for helping people regardless of status.

**The through-line is clear:** Jewish tzedakah traditions, Quaker testimonies, and Catholic Worker hospitality all share a commitment to serving human beings as such—without conversion requirements, without documentation demands, without deception. Your character could honestly present themselves to these organizations, contribute meaningfully through teaching and service, and access writing materials through an unbroken chain of public library services stretching back to 1914.

The Valley's libraries—from that first storefront in San Fernando to the 27,981-square-foot Mid-Valley Regional—have served as the most consistent, accessible, and unconditional resource for someone seeking knowledge, literacy tools, and community connection across every era. An immortal who values learning and teaching would find their most reliable refuge not in religious institutions but in the public library system, which has asked no questions and required no deception since its founding.
