## Overview: The Intersection

Samyaza is writing from millennia of isolation about catastrophic loss. He is:
- **Autistic** (high-functioning, pre-modern diagnosis era)
- **CPTSD survivor** (lost everyone he loved, learned of their fate centuries later, millennia of isolation)
- **Writing as attempt at meaning-making** (systematic effort to process the unprocessable)

The combination creates a unique narrative voice where literal, systematic thinking collides with grief, guilt, and the horror of reconstructed knowledge.

### The Nature of His Trauma

**Critical distinction:** Samyaza did not witness the flood. He was imprisoned before or during it—bound in the valleys of the earth, unable to see, unable to help, unable to know what was happening. 

He learned what happened to Awan and everyone he loved **centuries later**, through the Spanish mission system, when friars taught biblical stories to indigenous converts and Samyaza—existing on the margins, passing as one of the displaced—finally heard Genesis read aloud.

This creates a different but equally devastating form of trauma:
- **The not-knowing**: Centuries of uncertainty about what happened
- **The secondhand horror**: Learning the details from texts written by the perpetrator (God) and his apologists
- **The reconstruction**: His autistic mind obsessively piecing together what must have happened from fragmentary, biased sources
- **The powerlessness**: He could not warn them, could not save them, could not even witness their deaths
- **The framing**: The texts that told him what happened also told him it was *righteous*—that everyone he loved deserved to die

## Core Characteristics

### 1. Hyper-Detailed Sensory Observations vs. Emotional Gaps

**The Pattern:**
Autistic sensory processing means he can recall exact physical details from his time with Awan with crystalline precision, while being unable to access or articulate the emotional meaning. His memories of *her* are vivid; his knowledge of *the flood* is reconstructed from texts.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "Awan's hair—I can still see every strand. She wore it in seven braids, 
always seven, because she said it distributed the weight evenly across her 
scalp. The third braid from the left was slightly thicker. I noticed this 
on day forty-seven of knowing her. I never told her. What was the purpose 
of telling her? But now I think about that braid and I cannot [text breaks off]"

BAD: "I loved Awan and miss her terribly."
```

```
GOOD: "The irrigation channels she designed: seven primary, forty-three 
secondary, two hundred and nine tertiary. I can draw the complete system 
from memory. I have drawn it 2,847 times across six millennia. Each time 
I think: she built this. Each time I think: it is under sediment now. 
Each time I think: I never saw it destroyed. I only know it was."

BAD: "Her engineering work was impressive and I miss it."
```

### 2. Reconstructed Knowledge vs. Witnessed Memory

**The Pattern:**
His memories of Awan and their life together are firsthand—vivid, sensory, real. His knowledge of the flood comes from texts he encountered millennia later. He is acutely aware of this distinction and it torments him.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "I know the following things directly:
- The sound of her voice when she was tired
- The smell of the bread she preferred
- The way she gestured when explaining hydraulic principles
- The specific quality of afternoon light in the valley in late summer

I know the following things from texts written by people who were not there:
- That 'the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high 
  mountains under the whole heaven were covered'
- That 'everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of 
  life died'
- That this was righteous

The first category is true. The second category is someone else's account. 
I cannot reconcile them. I have been trying for 1,500 years, since a Franciscan 
friar read Genesis aloud in a language I had just learned, and I understood 
for the first time what had happened while I was bound in darkness."

BAD: "I learned about the flood later and it was hard to accept."
```

```
GOOD: "The friar said 'And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in 
the earth.' I wanted to ask: which men? I knew those men. I knew their names. 
I knew which ones were kind to strangers and which ones weren't. I knew 
Awan's nephew who was four years old. What wickedness did he commit?

But I could not ask. I was pretending to be someone who had never heard 
this story. I was pretending to be someone learning about God's mercy for 
the first time. I sat in the mission chapel and learned that everyone I 
loved had been wicked and deserved to drown, and I said nothing, because 
what could I say? Who would believe me?"

BAD: "The religious framing of the flood was hard to hear."
```

### 3. Systematic Attempts at Organization That Break Down

**The Pattern:**
He tries to impose order through categorization, chronology, lists, patterns—typical autistic coping. But the gap between his memories and his reconstructed knowledge won't cooperate with systems.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "I will proceed with what I know directly:

The valley: approximately 40 kilometers long, 15 kilometers wide
Population when I was imprisoned: estimated 12,000 persons
Awan's location when I last saw her: the eastern settlement, near the 
  irrigation hub she had designed

I will proceed with what Genesis claims:

Duration: 40 days and 40 nights of rain
Depth: 'fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail'
Survivors: 8 persons, none of whom I knew

I will attempt to reconcile these:

[This section has been blank for 400 years. I keep opening the document 
and looking at it. I cannot write the reconciliation because there is 
no reconciliation. The numbers don't work. 12,000 people minus 8 people 
equals everyone I knew. I keep doing this arithmetic as if it will 
change.]"

BAD: "It was hard to connect my memories with the biblical account."
```

### 4. Special Interests as Cognitive Life Raft

**The Pattern:**
His special interests (engineering, mathematics, natural systems, textual analysis) provide stable cognitive ground when grief threatens to overwhelm. He retreats into technical detail—but now that technical detail includes obsessive biblical scholarship.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "I should write about missing her but instead I will describe the 
hydraulic principles of the irrigation system she designed. Water pressure 
follows P = ρgh where ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, 
and h is depth. She understood this intuitively before I gave her the 
formula. She said 'the water knows where to go, you just have to show it 
the path.' I gave her the mathematics and she gave me the poetry.

The mathematics still work. The poetry is gone. I keep doing the calculations 
as if they will bring her back."

BAD: "I cope by thinking about technical things."
```

```
GOOD: "I have read Genesis in 847 translations. I have compared the Masoretic 
text to the Septuagint to the Vulgate to the Peshitta. I have analyzed 
every word choice. 'Mabbul' appears 13 times in the flood narrative. It 
means 'deluge' but its etymology is disputed. Some say it derives from 
'yabal,' to flow. Others connect it to 'balal,' to confuse or mix.

I have spent 200 years on this etymology. I tell myself it matters. It 
does not matter. She is still dead regardless of which Hebrew root applies. 
But I cannot stop analyzing the text because the text is all I have. The 
text and my memories. The memories of her are precious. The text is a lie 
that contains the only record of how the lie was carried out."

BAD: "I studied the Bible carefully to understand what happened."
```

### 5. The Trauma of Secondhand Knowledge

**The Pattern:**
CPTSD from learning about catastrophic loss, not witnessing it. The intrusive thoughts are about *what must have happened*—imagination filling gaps the texts leave empty. This is in some ways worse: he cannot stop his mind from constructing scenes he never saw.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "I do not know how she died. Genesis does not include this information. 
Genesis does not name her. Genesis says 'all flesh died that moved upon 
the earth' and does not specify which flesh belonged to Awan.

My mind fills in details. I cannot stop it. I imagine:
- Did the water reach her quickly or slowly?
- Was she alone or with family?
- Did she think of me?
- Did she know I would have saved her if I could?
- Did she know I was alive, somewhere, unable to help?

These are not memories. They are constructions. I know they are constructions. 
I cannot stop constructing them. I have been constructing them for 1,500 
years since I learned what happened."

BAD: "I often wonder how she died."
```

```
GOOD: "Last night I could not sleep because I was calculating water rise 
rates. If 'the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days' 
and 'all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered,' 
then the rate of rise would have been—

I am doing this again. I am trying to determine the precise hydraulics of 
her death. As if knowing the rate of rise would help. As if I could 
engineer my way backward through time and warn her. As if the mathematics 
could undo the mathematics.

She designed irrigation systems. She understood water. She would have 
known, watching the water rise, exactly how long she had. She would have 
done the calculations. She would have known there was no high ground 
high enough.

I cannot stop thinking about what she knew in those final hours. I was 
not there. I will never know. I cannot stop trying to calculate what 
I will never know."

BAD: "The uncertainty about her death is painful."
```

### 6. Difficulty with Theory of Mind in Retrospect

**The Pattern:**
Autistic difficulty modeling others' mental states means he struggles to understand why people made certain choices—including why she stayed when she could have fled to higher ground, why no one listened to warnings, why God decided what he decided.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "The text says Noah warned people. The text says they did not listen. 
I want to ask: what exactly did he say? How did he phrase it? Did he 
explain the engineering specifications of the ark? Did he provide data 
on projected rainfall?

I do not understand why people would not listen to clear data. I did not 
understand this when I was with them, and I do not understand it now. 
Awan understood. She used to translate my explanations into language 
other people could accept. She said 'You give them the numbers and I 
give them the story. Both are necessary.'

There was no one to give them the story about the flood. Or the story 
was wrong. Or they heard the story and did not believe it. I do not 
know which. I cannot ask them. The text does not say."

BAD: "It's hard to understand why people didn't listen to warnings."
```

### 7. Emotional Dysregulation Expressed as Narrative Disruption

**The Pattern:**
Both autism and CPTSD involve emotional regulation difficulties. In text, this manifests as sudden tonal shifts, abandonment of narrative thread, meta-commentary about his inability to continue.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "I am attempting to write a systematic account of my relationship 
with Awan. I will begin with our first meeting.

The forty-seventh day after the descent. She was adjusting an irrigation 
gate. The light was—

The light was—

She is dead. I learned this from a Franciscan friar in 1769. I sat in 
a chapel built with indigenous forced labor and I learned that the woman 
I loved had drowned approximately 6,000 years earlier and that this was 
good, this was just, this was God's righteous judgment upon the wicked.

I am not able to write about the light right now."

BAD: "It's hard to write about her without getting emotional."
```

```
GOOD: "Genesis 7:23: 'And every living substance was destroyed which was 
upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, 
and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and 
Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.'

Every living substance.
Both man.
And cattle.
And the creeping things.
And the fowl of the heaven.
And they were destroyed from the earth.

I have read this verse 10,000 times. I keep reading it. I keep thinking 
if I read it enough times it will stop being true. It does not stop 
being true. She was a living substance. She was destroyed from the earth.

I need to stop writing today."

BAD: "The biblical verses about the flood are hard to read."
```

### 8. Masking Fatigue in the Text Itself

**The Pattern:**
Autistic masking (performing neurotypical behavior) is exhausting. In his writing, you can see where he's trying to write "correctly" or "normally," and where that facade breaks down.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "I should begin with proper narrative structure. I have studied 
narrative structure extensively. I have read every craft book. I understand 
three-act structure, the hero's journey, in medias res, frame narratives.

I am attempting to employ a frame narrative: the present-day narrator 
recounting ancient events. This is a well-established technique. It 
creates productive distance between the telling and the told.

The distance is not helping. The distance is a lie. There is no distance. 
She is dead and I am here and I learned about her death from people who 
celebrated it as divine justice and I am supposed to write this with 
'productive distance'?

I do not know how to write this. I only know I have to write this. No 
one else will."

BAD: "I'm trying to tell this story properly but it's difficult."
```

### 9. Repetitive Thought Patterns

**The Pattern:**
Autistic repetitive cognition meets CPTSD's rumination. Certain phrases and calculations loop, both as self-soothing and as stuck cognitive records.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "She died and I was not there. She died and I was not there. She 
died and I was not there.

This is not poetic repetition. This is how I think about it. The thought 
arrives and does not leave. She died and I was not there. I was bound 
in darkness, I did not know, I could not help, I was not there.

I have been thinking this thought for 1,500 years. The thought does not 
change. The thought does not resolve. She died and I was not there and 
I will be thinking this until whatever counts as death for me finally 
arrives.

She died and I was not there."

BAD: "I think about her death often."
```

### 10. Pattern Recognition Applied to Textual Analysis

**The Pattern:**
Autistic pattern recognition is a strength, but he applies it obsessively to biblical texts trying to find patterns in divine behavior or moral causation—trying to understand, trying to find logic in genocide.

**Examples:**

```
GOOD: "I have analyzed the survivor selection criteria across every 
available textual tradition:

Genesis: Noah was 'righteous' and 'blameless'
1 Enoch: Noah was chosen before birth
Jubilees: Noah was 'perfect in his generations'

But:
- Awan was righteous by any measurable metric
- Her nephew was four years old (no moral agency)
- The woman in the northern settlement who fed travelers (never 
  mentioned in any accounting)

The pattern does not hold. I have been trying to make the pattern hold 
for 1,500 years. If the pattern held, it would mean there was logic. 
I could understand logic. I could accept logic, even cruel logic.

There was no logic. There was only power. Power that chose eight people 
and drowned everyone else and then had scribes write that this was 
righteous.

I cannot stop looking for the pattern. If I stop looking for the pattern, 
I have to accept that it was arbitrary. If it was arbitrary, then there 
was nothing she could have done. If there was nothing she could have 
done, then—"

BAD: "The selection of survivors seemed unfair and random."
```

## Narrative Techniques to Employ

### Temporal Disruption
- Present tense intrusions into past tense narration
- Sudden shifts between "then" (6,000 years ago) and "now" (San Fernando Valley)
- Collapse of time between the moment of loss and the present moment of writing

### The Gap Between Memory and Knowledge
- Clear distinction between what he witnessed (life with Awan) and what he learned (the flood)
- The horror of reconstruction—imagining what he didn't see
- Textual analysis as both coping mechanism and source of retraumatization

### White Space as Communication
- Literal gaps in the text where he cannot continue
- Section breaks that indicate "I walked away and came back"
- Incomplete sentences that trail off

### Meta-Commentary
- Direct acknowledgment of his writing process
- Statements about what he cannot write, will not write, should write
- Recognition of his own patterns: "I'm doing the thing where I analyze Hebrew etymology to avoid feelings again"

### Sensory Anchoring
- Grounding in specific, measurable details when overwhelmed
- Return to safe sensory observations (current temperature, sound of traffic, texture of paper)
- Contrasting vivid ancient memories with the muted present

### Failed Organizational Systems
- Multiple abandoned attempts at structure (chronological, thematic, by source text)
- Lists that break down mid-list
- Outlines that never get filled in
- Comparative textual analyses that lead nowhere

### Literal Confrontation with Euphemism
- Active rejection of comforting language
- "The text says 'perished.' The accurate word is 'drowned.' The text does not want to say 'drowned' because drowning is specific and horrible and 'perished' sounds peaceful."

---

## What This Voice Accomplishes

1. **Makes the reader work** - The fragmentation requires active engagement rather than passive consumption
2. **Authenticates the trauma** - A neat, linear account would be a lie
3. **Demonstrates neurodivergence without stating it** - Show through structure, not description
4. **Creates intimacy through vulnerability** - His inability to mask in writing brings the reader into genuine internal experience
5. **Challenges divine narrative** - His literal, systematic thinking exposes logical failures in religious justification
6. **Honors both conditions** - Neither the autism nor the CPTSD is "the problem"—both are authentic ways of being that shape his relationship to memory, knowledge, and meaning
7. **Explores the horror of secondhand knowledge** - Sometimes not witnessing is its own form of trauma

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't:
- Make him seem "broken" or "damaged" - he's functional, just different
- Use the autism as tragedy or inspiration porn
- Resolve the trauma with neat healing arc - CPTSD doesn't work that way
- Make every autistic trait about special abilities - include the genuinely difficult parts
- Forget he's a person writing, not symptoms writing
- Give him detailed sensory memories of events he didn't witness

### Do:
- Let him be funny, insightful, wrong, contradictory, human
- Show adaptation and coping without "overcoming"
- Include moments of connection despite the isolation
- Demonstrate competence alongside struggle
- Remember: he's been living with this for millennia - it's not new to him, just persistent
- Distinguish clearly between his vivid memories of Awan and his reconstructed knowledge of her death

---

## The Mission Context

Samyaza learned about the flood through Spanish mission teachings in California, likely in the late 18th century. This context matters:

- He was already displaced, already marginalized, already passing as someone else
- He learned the story alongside indigenous people who were themselves experiencing cultural genocide
- The irony is not lost on him: sitting in a mission built by forced labor, hearing about a flood that destroyed everyone he loved, being told this was God's mercy
- The friars taught Genesis as moral instruction; he heard it as confession of murder
- He has had approximately 250 years since then to process this knowledge (and has not finished processing it)

This creates additional layers:
- The texts are not neutral sources but tools of colonial power
- He understands something about how stories get weaponized
- He recognizes the pattern: destroy a people, then tell a story about why they deserved it
- His project of writing Awan's story is partly about refusing to let the victors' narrative stand unchallenged

---

**Document Purpose:** This guide establishes Samyaza's narrative voice as shaped by autism and CPTSD, with the critical understanding that his trauma comes from loss and secondhand knowledge rather than direct witnessing of the flood. His memories of Awan are firsthand and vivid; his knowledge of her death is reconstructed from texts written by those who justified it.

**Last Updated:** Revised to correct the misconception that Samyaza witnessed the flood directly. He was imprisoned before/during the flood and learned what happened centuries later through Spanish mission teachings.
