## Core Insight

Violence and harm don't happen without someone being responsible. But framing mechanisms obscure who has agency:

- **"AI is dangerous"** vs. **"People with power will use AI to harm others"**
- **"We are self-destructive"** vs. **"People with power destroy others to maintain that power"**
- **"The flood happened"** vs. **"Yahweh deliberately drowned everyone"**

The passive construction makes it sound like a natural force. The active construction identifies actors.

## The Mechanism

1. Active harm by people with power
2. Reframed as passive occurrence or collective responsibility  
3. Makes the victims complicit in their own harm
4. Makes resistance seem futile ("that's just how things are")
5. Protects the people actually making the decisions

## Examples Through History

### Biblical/Ancient World

**The Garden of Eden**
- Passive framing: "Sin entered the world," "humanity fell"
- Active reality: God created beings with limited knowledge, set up a test designed to fail, punished them and all descendants
- Effect: "We're fallen" makes it sound like something humanity did to itself

**The Flood**
- Passive: "Humanity became wicked"
- Active: God drowned everyone including children because some people didn't obey
- Effect: Collective guilt erases that this was wholesale slaughter decided by one being with power

**Abel and Cain**
- Passive: "There was murder"
- Active: God's arbitrary favoritism created jealousy that led to killing
- Effect: Divine role in creating the conditions for violence gets erased

**Tower of Babel**
- Passive: "Humanity got too proud"
- Active: People cooperated successfully and God sabotaged them by destroying their ability to communicate
- Effect: Framed as human hubris rather than divine insecurity about human achievement

**Sodom and Gomorrah**
- Passive: "Those cities were wicked"
- Active: God destroyed entire populations for the actions of some
- Effect: Collective punishment presented as justice

**The Curse of Ham**
- Passive: "It's the natural order" / "God ordained it"
- Active: People enslaving other people for economic gain, claiming divine justification
- Effect: Used for millennia to justify slavery as racial hierarchy rather than as an economic system requiring forced labor

### Medieval/Colonial Era

**Divine Right of Kings**
- Passive: "It's the natural order that some rule and others serve"
- Active: People with military power claim God backs them to justify their violence
- Effect: Hierarchy presented as inherent rather than imposed

**Colonialism**
- Passive: "These are savages who need civilizing"
- Active: We want their resources and land, so we're going to take them
- Effect: Indigenous peoples framed as naturally inferior rather than as victims of organized theft and genocide

**Witch Trials**
- Passive: "Evil exists among us"
- Active: Authorities using spectacle execution to maintain social control and eliminate inconvenient women
- Effect: Community-wide paranoia rather than institutional violence

### Industrial Revolution

**Slavery (again)**
- Multiple passive framings: "Natural racial hierarchy," "economic necessity," "civilizing mission"
- Active: People with power profiting from forced labor
- Effect: Even after abolition continues: "naturally criminal" (prison labor), "naturally lazy" (sharecropping), "naturally violent" (mass incarceration)

**Factory Conditions**
- Passive: "That's just how it is"
- Active: Owners choosing profit over worker safety
- Effect: Deaths and injuries framed as inevitable rather than as chosen priorities

**Wars**
- Passive: "Humans are naturally violent" / "war broke out"
- Active: Leaders send other people's children to die for resources, territory, or political power
- Effect: Abstraction obscures specific people declaring war

**The Great Depression**
- Passive: "Market forces" / "everyone got too greedy"
- Active: Specific banks and wealthy individuals made risky bets with other people's money and faced no consequences
- Effect: Systemic failure framed as collective responsibility

### Contemporary Era

**Climate Change**
- Passive: "We're all responsible" / "humans are destroying the planet"
- Active: 100 companies produce 71% of emissions; specific governments refused to regulate them for profit
- Effect: Individual responsibility (recycle! shorter showers!) deflects from corporate and political choices

**Economic Inequality**
- Passive: "People are lazy" / "they made bad choices"
- Active: Systems designed to concentrate wealth upward, with specific policy choices by specific people benefiting the already-wealthy
- Effect: Personal failings rather than structural design

**Police Violence**
- Passive: "Those neighborhoods are just violent"
- Active: Departments choosing aggressive tactics and protecting officers who kill
- Effect: Community pathology rather than institutional choices

**Opioid Crisis**
- Passive: "People made bad choices"
- Active: Pharmaceutical companies deliberately created addiction for profit, and regulators they'd captured looked away
- Effect: Addiction framed as personal failure rather than corporate crime

**Social Media Toxicity**
- Passive: "Technology is making us awful" / "human nature comes out online"
- Active: Platforms designed to maximize engagement by amplifying outrage because that's what their business model requires
- Effect: Algorithms treated as neutral when specific engineers implemented specific reward systems because specific executives decided that was most profitable

**"Tragedy of the Commons"**
- Passive: Communal resources always fail because people are selfish
- Active: What happens when you privatize commons and people lose shared investment
- Effect: Used to justify privatization while blaming "human nature" (note: this is a misuse of the actual paper)

**AI Risk**
- Passive: "AI will become dangerous and destroy us"
- Active: People with power will deploy AI in harmful ways for profit or control
- Effect: Framing of autonomous AI danger deflects from the humans wielding it

## Why This Matters for the Story

### The Genesis Narrative as Template

The Eden story is the original version of this pattern:
- God sets up the tree
- God forbids it  
- God doesn't explain why
- God punishes them
- God then tells the story as "humanity fell" rather than "I set a trap and punished them for it"

This narrative technology - obscuring who has agency and who's responsible - becomes the template for every subsequent power structure claiming divine mandate or natural law.

### The Internalization

Once you internalize the framework that violence and suffering are inevitable results of "human nature," you're primed to accept every other "that's just how it is" justification. The Eden story teaches people to see themselves as inherently flawed rather than as subjects of unjust power.

### Samyaza's Perspective

Watching the San Fernando Valley develop, Samyaza would see this pattern repeat constantly:

- Indigenous peoples labeled "savage" when colonizers wanted their land
- Workers told factory conditions were "natural" when owners wanted higher profits  
- Various groups told their subjugation was "God's will" when the powerful wanted to maintain advantage
- AI and social media - tools that could genuinely help people connect, learn, organize - deliberately designed to maximize engagement through outrage because that's more profitable

Same pattern, new technology. Not "technology made us this way" but "people with power shaped these tools to benefit themselves at everyone else's expense."

### Dinah's Story as Example

The text handles this both ways:
- Weirdly specific about Shechem's actions (active: he raped her)
- Frames the brothers' massacre almost as inevitable consequence rather than choice (passive: "there was violence")
- Who chose what? Who had agency? The passive framing obscures the answer

### Thematic Application

The story needs to constantly force the question: **Who chose this?**

- Yahweh chose to limit Eve's knowledge
- Yahweh chose the setup
- Yahweh chose the punishment  
- Yahweh chose to keep choosing punishment for generations

The "we're fallen" framing makes it sound like something humanity did to itself. The active framing reveals the power structure.

## Story Implementation Notes

- Narrative voice should attend to this carefully - when does it use passive vs. active construction?
- Do characters recognize this pattern?
- The gods certainly benefit from humans internalizing "we're just naturally bad" rather than "you're choosing to hurt us"
- Modern sections can show how this same pattern continues
- Awan, with her analytical mind, might be one of the first to see through this framing
