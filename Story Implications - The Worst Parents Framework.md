# Story Implications - The Worst Parents Framework

## Core Dynamic

The unprecedented situation of **omniscient beings trying to raise someone who must learn everything sequentially** creates the fundamental tension of your stories.

## Key Themes

- **Natural innocence vs. imposed shame**
- **Sequential learning vs. instant knowledge**
- **Physical dependency vs. created capability**
- **Developmental process vs. adult expectations**
- **Inherited trauma vs. natural childhood**
