# The Shame Teaching Problem

## Built-in vs. Learned Shame

**The Theological Paradox**: Adam and Eve's shame about nakedness came instantly with their disobedience - their first emotion after eating the forbidden fruit. But this shame is tied to their specific act of rebellion and sudden awareness of good and evil.

**Awan's Natural State**: Awan is born innocent, without having committed original sin herself. She would naturally be comfortable with her body until _taught_ otherwise.

## The Teaching Crisis

- How do Adam and Eve explain shame to someone who hasn't experienced the fall?
- Do they try to impose their post-fall shame on their innocent children?
- Is nakedness shameful for Awan, or only for Adam and Eve?

**Story Potential**:

- Awan running around naked as a child while parents frantically try to clothe her
- The moment when Awan first feels self-conscious about her body
- Tension when Awan questions why covering up is necessary when it feels unnatural
