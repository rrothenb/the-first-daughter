**Purpose & context**

Rick is developing "The Book of Awan," a biblical fiction novel that reinterprets Genesis as a cautionary tale about divine narcissism rather than moral instruction. The project centers on Awan (Adam and Eve's first daughter) as the true architect of early civilization and Samyaza (leader of the fallen Watchers) as a frame narrator writing from contemporary isolation in the San Fernando Valley. Rick's central thesis argues that Genesis was meant as a cautionary tale about narcissistic divinity, but successive reinterpretations by those seeking power have weaponized it into a tool of oppression throughout history.

The novel employs a sophisticated multi-layered structure. Samyaza's contemporary frame narrative takes place in present-day San Fernando Valley where he lives marginalized, mistaken for indigenous, experiencing ongoing consequences of how his story was weaponized. His attempts to write the Book of Awan fragment across three types of memory that interrupt each other: pre-trauma firsthand memories of peaceful times with Awan and later with Valley indigenous peoples, traumatic firsthand memories of Spanish colonization and ongoing marginalization that remain fragmented and difficult to access, and Awan's own stories that he preserves obsessively as secondhand memories. Valley vignettes connect ancient events to San Fernando Valley history spanning from indigenous peoples through contemporary times. Critically, Samyaza's metacommentary about how stories work is integrated directly into his narrative voice, not presented as separate Talmudic-style commentary sections.

Rick approaches the project with rigorous first-principles methodology, relying solely on textual evidence from Genesis (treating it as neutral-toned) while rejecting moral overlays from later sources like 1 Enoch. He applies modern scientific knowledge about human psychology, neurobiology, and ancient Mesopotamian geography to ground supernatural elements in authentic frameworks. The novel functions as both standalone fiction and teaching tool, explicitly instructing readers about narrative weaponization while implicitly demonstrating trauma effects through its fragmented structure.

Key collaborators in Rick's research include extensive engagement with Jewish religious texts through Sefaria, biblical scholarship on Genesis composition and interpretation history, trauma research for character psychology, and historical analysis of the San Fernando Valley from 2000 BCE through present day. Rick has developed custom analytical frameworks including an 8-dimensional biblical personality system and detailed character development using Dramatica theory's 64 elements.

**Approach & patterns**

Rick employs systematic engineering methodology to novel construction, treating narrative structure as information architecture with clear dependencies and logical progression. He prefers prescriptive rather than exploratory approaches, building comprehensive frameworks before proceeding to execution phases. His research process involves creating extensive checklists, detailed character analyses using multiple theoretical systems, and rigorous documentation in Obsidian with GitHub version control.

Rick's analytical approach distinguishes between active involvement and passive inquiry, avoiding assumptions about expertise or roles based on questions alone. He consistently applies first-principles thinking, challenging conventional interpretations and demanding textual evidence over speculation. When encountering contradictions or gaps, he systematically identifies highest-risk elements before proceeding, following spiral development methodology.

His collaborative style with Claude emphasizes informal, direct workshop dynamics rather than performative interactions. Rick values honest assessment over encouragement, providing direct feedback when recommendations miss the mark and preferring concrete structural examples over abstract theory. He demonstrates self-awareness about research patterns while asserting autonomy over his creative process.

Rick organizes complex information through dependency mapping, treating narrative sequencing as both construction challenges (order of building steps) and presentation challenges (pedagogical sequencing of evidence). He consistently connects theoretical frameworks to practical narrative applications, ensuring analytical insights serve story development rather than becoming academic exercises.

**Tools & resources**

Rick's primary infrastructure centers on Obsidian for note-taking and project organization, with GitHub integration for version control and collaboration (repository: rrothenb/the-first-daughter). He uses Sefaria.org extensively for Jewish religious text research, accessing primary sources and commentaries for textual analysis. His research methodology incorporates comprehensive web searches for historical, scientific, and scholarly sources, particularly focusing on trauma research, biblical scholarship, and San Fernando Valley history.

Key reference works include extensive biblical and apocryphal texts (Genesis, 1 Enoch, Book of Jubilees, Talmudic sources), scientific papers on Mesopotamian geography and morphodynamics, trauma research frameworks from contemporary psychology, and historical analyses of textual weaponization and interpretation history. Rick has developed custom analytical tools including his 8-dimensional biblical personality system and detailed applications of Dramatica theory's 64 character elements.

His technical approach leverages systematic research checklists covering over 100 topics, comprehensive timelines connecting ancient events to modern contexts, and structured documentation systems that support both creative development and scholarly rigor. Rick maintains clear organizational boundaries between active project materials, archived content, and materials under consideration (especially the "To Fix, Reword, or Reject" directory which should be ignored unless specifically referenced), enabling systematic progression from research through planning to execution phases.
