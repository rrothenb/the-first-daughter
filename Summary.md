**Purpose:** Read this file at the start of every conversation about this project before responding to anything.

---

## Core Premise (Settled)

- **Genesis is literal** - events happened as described, but the moral framing is propaganda
- **Genesis was a cautionary tale** - later weaponized by those seeking power
- **God is a narcissist** - values adulation above all else; this is not metaphor
- **Reject moral overlays from later sources** - especially 1 Enoch's demonization of Watchers
- **First principles only** - no conventional wisdom, no assumptions about how we think today; only textual evidence and scientific knowledge about biology, climate, geography

---

## The Novel's Frame (Settled)

- **Narrator:** Samyaza, leader of the Watchers
- **His project:** Writing "The Book of Awan" to set the record straight
- **Actually about:** His investigation into HOW his story was weaponized - NOT trauma processing but pedagogy. After Spanish colonization, he learned Christianity (immediate weapon), Judaism (sources), literary theory (mechanisms) to understand narrative weaponization
- **Novel's dual function:** Standalone fiction AND explicit teaching tool about how stories become weapons through successive reinterpretation
- **Working title:** "The Book of Awan" (like Tenacious D's "Tribute" - not the thing itself, but an attempt at the thing)
- **No Talmudic-style commentary sections** - metacommentary about stories is integrated into Samyaza's voice, not separated out

---

## Samyaza (Settled)

### Identity
- INTP, high-functioning autistic (undiagnosed, pre-modern)
- Brilliant but unable/unwilling to manipulate people to advance
- Mesopotamian appearance - olive/brown skin, dark hair, Semitic features
- Racially ambiguous in California: readable as indigenous, Mexican, Armenian, Middle Eastern depending on era

### Present Circumstances
- Lives in San Fernando Valley, has for millennia
- Marginalized, part of underclass, essentially a person of color
- Undocumented - literally cannot have documentation; doesn't fit any identity system
- Poor - no wealth accumulation, no social climbing
- Nameless, faceless, forgettable despite brilliance
- Currently readable as Latino; lives in East Valley with working-class immigrants

### Critical: He Did NOT Witness the Flood
- Imprisoned before or during flood - bound in darkness, unable to see or help
- Learned what happened **centuries later** through Spanish mission system
- Sat in mission chapels built by forced labor and heard Genesis read aloud
- Learned everyone he loved was "wicked" and deserved to drown
- This shapes everything: his memories of Awan are vivid firsthand; his knowledge of her death is reconstructed from hostile texts

### His Trauma
- **Primary trauma:** Spanish colonization and ongoing marginalization (NOT the flood/imprisonment directly)
- Swept into mission system, forced labor, witnessed cultural genocide of indigenous peoples
- Experienced every cycle of violence against marginalized people in Valley history
- His immortality traps him inside history, doesn't elevate him above it

---

## Samyaza's Three Memory Types (Settled)

1. **Pre-trauma firsthand memories** - vivid sensory detail of time with Awan and later with Tongva/Tataviam; high precision on physical details, low understanding of emotional/social meaning

2. **Traumatic firsthand memories** - Spanish colonization, ongoing marginalization; fragmented, difficult to access

3. **Awan's stories (secondhand)** - her exact words preserved, but meanings uncertain; frozen and uncorrectable; triple-layered (her original telling, his hearing, his grief)

These interrupt each other. The fragmentation IS the structure.

---

## Awan (Settled)

- Adam and Eve's first daughter (from Book of Jubilees)
- **Born IN Eden** - has childhood memories of the garden and the expulsion; experienced paradise before exile
- True architect of early civilization - the one written out of canonical scripture
- Represents an ideal state: communal, inquisitive, neurodiverse, comfortable with sex and body, free of shame, kind, generous
- Embodies organic morality that might emerge when everyone is siblings (**Westermarck effect**: in founding population where everyone grew up together, universal sexual aversion exists between relatives; Watchers were first beings without that neurological aversion trigger, reframing attraction as neurologically-determined rather than seduction)
- INTJ in MBTI terms
- Lived ~900 years (antediluvian lifespan); puberty ~90, menopause ~450
- **By Watcher arrival (~year 460), Awan is matriarch of ~760,000 people** across 4 generations - Watchers arrive into HER civilization
- Was alive when Watchers descended (she'd be 376-544 years old)
- Samyaza meets her when she's past childbearing age (post-450)

---

## Antediluvian Lifespan Framework (Settled)

- Typical lifespan: ~900 years
- Puberty: ~90 years
- Menopause: ~450 years
- Development scales proportionally
- NO normalized timeline (don't convert to modern 75-year equivalents)

---

## Key Worldbuilding Elements (Settled)

### Mesopotamian Tidal Irrigation
- Based on Giosan & Goodman scientific research on Sumerian morphodynamics
- Tidal freshwater reached far inland (similar to modern Amazon)
- Self-regulating system: floods deposited sediments, ebbs flushed salts
- Made agriculture possible without sophisticated engineering
- Foundation for early civilization development
- Natural system Awan observed and worked with

### Adam and Eve as Failed Parenting Template
- Created as adults - never experienced childhood, no developmental stages
- No attachment models, no parenting instinct (never were parented themselves)
- **Eve cannot be a template for future mothers** - her experience too unique, too unprecedented
- **Awan is the real "first mother"** - born, had childhood, experienced being parented (however inadequately)
- Awan has basis for comparison, can choose to replicate or reject Eve's methods
- First to create actual parenting culture that other women can follow

---

## Opening (Current Direction)

- Novel opens with Samyaza reflecting on "bereshit" as a first word
- What it means, how elegant it is, why he can't top it
- Establishes him as literary, self-aware narrator thinking about HOW to tell a story
- First chapter possibly titled "Bereshit"
- Hebrew centrality: the book will teach readers about Hebrew and translation choices

---

## Themes to Explore

Neurodiversity, modern trauma theory, natural morality, communism/communalism, writing, how Genesis was weaponized over time, rise of western civilization, colonialism, communication, San Fernando Valley, Spanish mission system, autistic masking, postmodernism, literary theory, software engineering, rise of movie industry, Jesus' rejection of Old Testament and later undoing by others, capitalism, knowledge, progress, technology, learning, the Watchers, Westermarck effect, neuroscience, translation, Nietzsche, humor

---

## Valley Vignettes (Structural Element)

Connect ancient events to San Fernando Valley history:
- Pre-contact Tongva/Tataviam
- Mission system (1797-1834)
- Land Claims Act dispossession
- Water heist / Owens Valley (Chinatown)
- Japanese internment
- Postwar white flight / redlining
- Rodney King / 1992 riots
- Present-day ICE enforcement, housing crisis, gentrification

Samyaza present throughout as participant-observer - not shaping events, shaped by same forces that shape everyone on margins.

---

## What's NOT Settled / Still In Flux

- Exact structure and pacing of how education about story mechanics gets distributed
- Specific scenes and events to dramatize
- How much to show vs. tell regarding literary theory
- Vault organization (see Todo.md for cleanup priorities)
- Whether title should have quotes around it ("The Book of Awan")
- Whether to use Hebrew title with English subtitle

---

## Resources

- **Primary texts:** Sefaria.org for Jewish religious texts including apocrypha
- **Project files:** Obsidian vault synced to GitHub (rrothenb/the-first-daughter)
- **Ignore:** Anything in "To Fix, Reword, or Reject" directory unless specifically asked

---

## Working With Rick

- Informal, direct, collaborative workshop tone
- Honest assessment over encouragement
- Concrete examples over abstract theory
- Don't ask follow-up questions just to keep things going
- Search project files before responding to project-related queries
- When Rick shares information, verify against project files rather than just engaging conversationally

---
