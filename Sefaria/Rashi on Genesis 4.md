3

In the course of time, [[Cain]] brought an offering to from the fruit of the soil;

4

and Abel, for his part, brought the choicest of the firstlings of his flock. paid heed to Abel and his offering,

5

but to [[Cain]] and his offering \[[[God]]\] paid no heed. [[Cain]] was much distressed and his face fell.

6

And said to [[Cain]],  
“Why are you distressed,  
And why is your face fallen?  

7

<sup>*</sup> *Meaning of verse uncertain.* Surely, if you do right,  
There is uplift.  
But if you do not do right  
Sin couches at the door;  
Its urge is toward you,  
Yet you can be its master.”

8

[[Cain]] said to his brother Abel … <sup>*</sup> ***…** Ancient versions, including the Targum, read “Come, let us go out into the field.”* and when they were in the field, [[Cain]] set upon his brother Abel and killed him.

9

said to [[Cain]], “Where is your brother Abel?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”

10

“What have you done? Hark, your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground!

11

Therefore, you shall be more cursed than the ground,<sup>*</sup> ***more cursed than the ground** See 3.17.* which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.

12

If you till the soil, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. You shall become a ceaseless wanderer on earth.”

13

[[Cain]] said to , “My punishment is too great to bear!

14

Since You have banished me this day from the soil, and I must avoid Your presence and become a restless wanderer on earth—anyone who meets me may kill me!”

15

said to him, “I promise, if anyone kills [[Cain]], sevenfold vengeance shall be exacted.” And put a mark on [[Cain]], lest anyone who met him should kill him.

16

[[Cain]] left the presence of and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

17

[[Cain]] knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he then founded a city, and named the city after his son Enoch.

18

To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael <sup>*</sup> ***Mehujael** Heb. *Meḥiya’el*.* begot Methusael, and Methusael begot Lamech.

19

Lamech took to himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other was Zillah.

20

Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who dwell in tents and amidst herds.

21

And the name of his brother was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all who play the lyre and the pipe.

22

As for Zillah, she bore Tubal-[[Cain]], who forged all implements of copper and iron. And the sister of Tubal-[[Cain]] was Naamah.

23

And Lamech said to his wives,  
“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;  
O wives of Lamech, give ear to my speech.  
I have slain a person for wounding me,  
And a lad for bruising me.  

24

If [[Cain]] is avenged sevenfold,  
Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”

25

[[Adam]] knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, meaning, “[[God]] has provided me with <sup>*</sup> ***provided me with** Or “established for me”; Heb. *shath*, connected with “Seth.”* another offspring in place of Abel,” for [[Cain]] had killed him.

26

And to Seth, in turn, a son was born, and he named him Enosh. It was then that began to be invoked by name.
