# Core Decisions - Awan Novel Project

This document contains the fundamental interpretive frameworks and first-principles decisions that guide all other work on this project.

## Central Theme

**"How did we get here?"**

Where "here" means: a world that reads Genesis as a morality tale about obedience to a benevolent God, when it's actually a record of divine narcissistic abuse and the human cost of that dysfunction.

The question works on multiple levels:
- How did humans end up with this abusive concept of God?
- How did the first generation gap poison everything after?
- How did we lose the actual story and end up with the sanitized version?
- How did we get from God's original control program to a collapsed civilization that rebuilt the same patterns digitally?

**Supporting Themes:**
- Divine Narcissism: God's directives as abuse, not morality
- Generational Trauma: Being raised by parents who have zero concept of what you're going through
- Story Weaponization: How we've recorded, communicated, twisted, and evolved these formative stories
- Knowledge as Liberation: What God calls "forbidden" is actually freedom
- Pattern Recognition: The same control mechanisms repeating across millennia

## Time Normalization Rules

**Critical Framework:** Biblical ages in the antediluvian period are unrealistic. We use a conversion system to create psychologically plausible human timescales.

### Three-Period Approach

**Period 1: Antediluvian (Creation to Flood - 1656 biblical years)**
- **Apply 12:1 conversion** (1 biblical year = 1 month actual time)
- Justification: Lifespans of 365-969 years are biologically unrealistic
- Result: Adam lives 77.5 years, Methuselah 80.75 years, Noah 79.2 years
- All ages and timeframes divided by 12 to get "real" ages

**Period 2: Post-Flood Transitional (Flood to Joseph - ~650 biblical years)**
- **Gradual natural normalization - NO conversion needed**
- Lifespans decline organically: Shem 600 → Peleg 239 → Joseph 110
- Tower of Babel (around Peleg) marks acceleration point
- This reflects actual environmental/genetic changes in the narrative

**Period 3: Normalized Era (Joseph onward)**
- **NO conversion needed**
- Psalm 90:10 establishes 70-80 years as normal ("The days of our lives in it are seventy years")
- Moses lives 120 years (exceptional but realistic)
- Lifespans match historical reality

### Key Timeline Anchors (Normalized)

- **Year 0:** Creation/Eden established
- **Year 8:** Awan born in Eden (with Cain, Abel, Aclima as quadruplets)
- **Year 10:** The transgression (eating from the tree)
- **Year 12:** Expulsion from Eden (Awan age 4, has Eden memories)
- **Year 16:** Abel's murder (Awan age 8)
- **Year 20:** Cain's exile begins (4-year gap after murder allows psychological processing)
- **Year 21:** Enoch born, first city (Eridu) founded
- **Year 38:** Samyaza and the Watchers arrive (Awan age 30)
- **Year 75:** Awan dies (900 biblical years ÷ 12)
- **Year 138:** The Flood (1656 biblical years ÷ 12)

### Important Gaps

- **2-year gap** between eating the fruit and expulsion (years 10-12)
- **4-year gap** between Abel's murder and Cain's exile (years 16-20)
- These gaps allow for psychological processing, family dynamics, and complex decision-making rather than immediate divine punishment

### Special Cases

**Sanhedrin "Hours":** These are LITERAL hours, not years. Sanhedrin 38b describes Adam's creation day hour-by-hour during a single 12-hour day. Do NOT convert to years.

**"Generation":** Already a normalized concept representing parent-to-child intervals (variable duration, roughly 20-40 years depending on individual). No conversion needed.

**Flood Dating:** Precisely 1656 years after creation according to Genesis chronology (Seder Olam Rabbah). With 12:1 conversion = 138 actual years from creation to flood.

## Natural Morality Framework

**Core Premise:** God in this story is understood as a narcissistic, controlling entity whose "morality" is actually abuse. Traditional biblical judgments of right/wrong are products of this corrupted divine influence.

### What to Avoid

DO NOT use these traditional framings:
- Don't describe the Watchers as "corrupting" or "seducing" humanity
- Don't frame knowledge-sharing as "forbidden" or negative
- Don't assume disobedience to God is "sin" or wrong
- Don't describe the Nephilim as "abominations"
- Don't frame the pre-flood world as requiring "cleansing"

### Alternative Framings

Instead, consider:
- **The Watchers** may be offering choice and agency to humans trapped under divine control
- **Knowledge** (including what God calls "forbidden") is simply knowledge - neutral or positive
- **Human-angel relationships** represent voluntary choices, possibly even love
- **The Nephilim** are simply hybrid children, not inherently evil (possibly beautiful, impressive, wonderful examples of what was possible)
- **Violence and problems** in the pre-flood world may stem from God's dysfunction, not human/angel "corruption"

### Natural Morality Focuses On

- Authentic connection between beings
- Personal agency and choice
- The sharing of knowledge as positive/liberating
- Survival and adaptation in traumatic circumstances
- Building community despite oppressive divine oversight
- Love and friendship across boundaries as potentially liberating

### Evidence from Texts

**God's Inconsistent Rules:**
- Rules revealed through experience, not clear commandments
- Punishment for violations of unstated rules (Cain's offering rejected with no prior explanation of what was wanted)
- God creates competitive situations (demanding sacrifices), shows arbitrary favoritism, then acts shocked when jealousy and violence result
- The serpent told the truth about what would happen; God didn't (they didn't die "that day")

**Psychological Effects:**
Research on unpredictable/inconsistent parenting shows:
- Learned helplessness (Seligman 1967)
- Anxiety and depression
- Difficulty trusting authority
- Complex PTSD from unpredictable environment
- Awan and early humans would experience these exact psychological effects

**Alternative Religious Interpretations:**
- **Gnostic Christianity:** God of Genesis is the Demiurge (false god); serpent is hero bringing knowledge
- **Early Jewish tradition:** Eating from tree was necessary transition from innocence to moral agency, not a "fall"
- **The text itself** is remarkably ambiguous about whose side we're on - later theology flattened this ambiguity

## First Principles Approach

**Foundational Directive:** Avoid making assumptions that reflect conventional wisdom or how we think today.

### Base Everything On

1. **What the texts actually say** (using Sefaria.org as primary source)
   - Hebrew/Aramaic original language when relevant
   - Multiple Jewish sources (Torah, Talmud, Midrash, apocryphal texts)
   - Don't assume the narrator's perspective = God's perspective = correct moral stance

2. **Scientific understanding** of biology, climate, geography, ecosystem
   - Actual Mesopotamian marsh ecology (pre-1980s destruction)
   - Agricultural practices in deltaic environments
   - Human physiology and neurology
   - Real animal behavior and ecosystems for the region/period

3. **Psychological realism** given the circumstances
   - How would people actually respond to these situations?
   - What are the effects of unprecedented experiences (first death, first exile, etc.)?
   - How do embodied minds develop morality without cultural precedent?

### Key Examples

**Death:** Before Cain killing Abel, humans had never experienced death. They could conceivably not have known that Cain's actions would cause Abel to die. Approach from place of innocence.

**Parenting:** Adam and Eve were created as adults - they have no experience of childhood, no model for parenting. They would be genuinely terrible at it, not through malice but through complete inexperience.

**Geography:** Don't assume "Eden" was a lush garden paradise. Al-Qurnah region was marshland transitioning to semi-arid - challenging environment, not utopia.

**Agriculture:** Naive farming at marsh edges working WITH flood cycles would be sustainable, not depleting. Only becomes destructive with attempts to control/prevent natural flooding.

## What This Novel IS and IS NOT

### This Novel Is NOT:
- A traditional biblical retelling affirming religious values
- A story where God is ultimately right
- A tale of human corruption requiring divine intervention  
- A work that treats "forbidden knowledge" as genuinely dangerous
- A multi-narrator postmodern experiment with competing unreliable voices
- An exhaustive exploration of every biblical character's perspective

### This Novel IS:
- A forensic analysis of how abusive patterns perpetuate across millennia
- A feminist reclamation of erased women's stories (Awan specifically)
- A critique of how we weaponize ancient texts to serve power
- An exploration of being raised by traumatized, incompetent parents
- A meditation on isolation and what we do when there's no one to perform for
- A structurally simple narrative (apartment/valley framing)
- A contemporary voice speaking truth about ancient events
- A single, clear narrative that trusts readers to handle moral complexity

---

## Narrator Decision: Samyaza

**Single narrator:** Samyaza, leader of the Watchers, imprisoned in the San Fernando Valley

**Why this works:**
- Rational critic of God
- Lover of humanity and witness to Awan's struggles
- Imprisoned contemporary observer witnessing the development of communication and society
- Quest to set the record straight
- His voice is naturally postmodern (comparing memories to broken, contradictory textual tradition)
- One strong voice beats competing voices when the thesis is already clear

**What was cut:**
- Uriel as co-narrator (unnecessary; represents divine order we're rejecting)
- Multiple competing unreliable narrators (too complex; dilutes message)
- Structural complexity for its own sake

---

## Source Materials

**Primary:** Original Jewish texts at Sefaria.org
- Genesis/Bereshit
- Talmud (especially Sanhedrin)
- Book of Enoch (1 Enoch)
- Book of Jubilees
- Midrash Rabbah
- Other apocryphal and pseudepigraphical texts as relevant

**Supporting Research:**
- Mesopotamian archaeology and history
- Marsh ecology and agricultural systems
- Embodied cognition and neuroscience
- Trauma research and developmental psychology
- Alternative religious interpretations (Gnostic texts, etc.)

**Critical Secondary Source:**
- "Morphodynamic Foundations of Sumer" (Giosan & Goodman, PLOS One, 2025) - explains how tidal changes shaped Sumerian civilization and timing of urbanization

---

## Writing Priorities

1. Make Awan a fully realized character with interior life
2. Ground the ancient world in sensory, physical reality
3. Let Samyaza's contemporary voice carry the analysis naturally
4. Show God's narcissism through actions, not labels
5. Treat knowledge-sharing as genuinely liberating
6. Make the San Fernando Valley connection illuminate, not distract
7. Trust the central themes without overcomplicating

**Document Purpose:** This captures the interpretive foundations that MUST remain consistent across all project work. When in doubt, return to these principles.

**Last Updated:** Based on comprehensive conversation review during project consolidation
