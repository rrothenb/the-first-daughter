# Specific Parenting Failures and Misunderstandings

## The Language Acquisition Crisis

**The Problem**: Adam immediately spoke when he saw Eve. When baby Awan babbles or points instead of speaking clearly, Adam and Eve think something is wrong with her rather than understanding this is normal development.

**Story Potential**:

- Parents frantically trying to "fix" Awan's inability to speak complete sentences
- Assuming she's defective rather than developing normally
- No concept that language learning is a process

## Physical Dependency Confusion

**The Problem**: Eve was created fully capable. When Awan needs help with basic tasks, can't reach things, or requires protection, Adam and Eve don't grasp that this helplessness is temporary and developmental rather than a permanent deficiency.

**Story Potential**:

- Parents confused by Awan's need for physical assistance
- Treating her dependency as failure rather than natural development
- No understanding that children require gradual independence

## The Experience of Not-Knowing

**The Problem**: Adam and Eve have never experienced ignorance, confusion, or gradual understanding. They can't empathize with Awan's frustration at not comprehending something immediately, or her need to ask "why" repeatedly.

**Story Potential**:

- Parents baffled by Awan's need to touch fire to understand it burns
- Confusion when she needs to taste bitter things repeatedly
- No patience for trial-and-error learning
