### Neurological Evidence

- **Mirror Neurons**: Fire both when experiencing and witnessing others' pain
- **Empathy Development**: Emerges through caregiver interactions in early childhood
- **Shame Learning**: Develops through social co-regulation, mirror neuron activation, and attachment relationships
- **Gender Differences**: Women may show greater empathic responses neurologically

### Embodied Morality (Lakoff & Johnson)

- Moral concepts arise from bodily experiences
- Abstract moral thinking grounded in physical metaphors:

### Embodied Morality (Lakoff & Johnson)

- Moral concepts arise from bodily experiences
- Abstract moral thinking grounded in physical metaphors:
    - "Moral is up/immoral is down"
    - "Moral purity is cleanliness"
    - "Well-being is wealth"
- Fairness emerges from embodied experiences of balance
- Empathy from capacity to simulate others' physical states
- Moral disgust activates same brain regions as physical disgust

### Pre-Tree Natural Morality

- [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] should have had innate moral intuitions from being embodied beings
- Sense of fairness from balance
- Basic empathy through mirror neurons
- Disgust responses
