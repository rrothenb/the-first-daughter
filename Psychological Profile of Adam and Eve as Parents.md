# Psychological Profile of Adam and Eve as Parents

## Developmental Arrest/Stunted Emotional Growth

- Created with adult bodies but child-like emotional regulation
- Never learned to self-soothe, negotiate boundaries, or develop independent identity
- Stuck in perpetual state of seeking external validation and direction

## Attachment Disorders

- **Anxious-Preoccupied with God**: Desperate need for divine approval, terror of abandonment
- **Disorganized attachment with children**: Want to be nurturing parents but have no template for healthy parent-child relationships
- Oscillate between over-involvement and emotional distance with offspring

## Trauma-Related Issues

- **PTSD from expulsion**: Hypervigilance, intrusive memories of Eden, inability to feel safe
- **Complex trauma**: Their "childhood" was essentially a traumatic rupture (the Fall)
- **Dissociation**: May disconnect from overwhelming emotions about their failures

## Parental Inadequacy Syndrome

- **Role confusion**: Sometimes treat children as peers, sometimes as authority figures
- **Emotional parentification**: Look to their children for comfort they can't provide themselves
- **Inconsistent boundaries**: Don't understand developmental needs because they never had them met

## Codependency with God

- **Learned helplessness**: Unable to make decisions without divine input
- **Identity fusion**: Can't distinguish their wants/needs from what they think God wants
- **Chronic shame**: Deep belief they're fundamentally flawed (original sin internalized)
