Let’s say I wanted to write a novel who’s main theme is that the god of genesis was a narcissist and that it was meant as a cautionary tale by its author, much like stories of Greek, Roman, and Norse gods were, and not as a directive to obey him. And to illuminate this theme, follow the development of Adam and eves children and how god’s interference (like causing the jealousy of Cain by favoring Abel) was evil and that gaining knowledge was good. Furthermore, let us assume that samyaza, one of the leaders of the watchers who taught mankind various skills, knew and had a platonic love for Awan, Cain’s wife and that he was good and recognized god’s evil and was trapped for 70 generations in the San Fernando valley and watched it grow up till present day and the near future. What things could have Samyaza have experienced in the valley that would strengthen the theme rather than detract from it?  Is there value in the addition of the framing story for showing how our reading of genesis has caused more harm than good over these many millennia?

Assuming only that we misread genesis and that misreading continues in the near future, can we infer a dystopian result from the confluence of that idea with known other drivers that might strongly affect our future, like AI and social media?

I suppose that if my premise is god bad, knowledge good, I need to construct things such that it’s clear that AI and social media are inherently good, but that religion and those in power subverted them somehow. I had been considering a dystopian future wherein the very rich lived in fully automated luxury skyscrapers and only ever communicated with their own personal AI, but society broke down and there was no longer any power to run them so all the rich died in their high tech tombs (except for samyaza who was immortal). It might be hard to argue that AI and social media had been good things with an ending like that. I would need to clearly show how they had been manipulated by the same forces that twisted the meaning of genesis in order to subjugate the masses. Would Marxism be useful here?  Even though I’m drawn to this sprawling epic story, I’d still like to try and be frugal in that everything I do introduce should contribute to the underlying theme. 

One thought I have is that before samyaza was trapped in the valley, he would likely have been a Marxist. Capitalism didn’t exist. Everyone was part of the same family and knew each other. There were no strangers. Everything would have been shared. When native Americans first showed up in the valley, they too would have had no concept of private property. But when Europeans finally showed up in the valley that would be his first exposure to capitalism and it would have seemed evil. 

So the story, in a nutshell, is samyaza comparing his admiration for Awan and humanity’s ingenuity in handling god’s arbitrary rules and cruel punishments with what western civilization created by twisting those stories and weaponizing them against the common man to create inequality where it hadn’t previously existed. He provides a blueprint, from his experiences of being a watcher of mankind, of how Cain and his descendants were creating a modern utopia while Seth did nothing but fawn to god who then decided to kill everyone interested in knowledge, progress, and improvement, leaving only those who worshipped him, despite plenty of evidence to the idea that they shouldn’t. 

This is at it's core a story about stories.  About writing.  I think Samyaza's goal is to write the book of awan.  The structure of this novel includes reminiscences of Samyaza, draft chapters of the book of awan, commentaries and supplementary material in the style of various jewish texts like the talmud, informal musings about the writing process and the way that others may take what you've written and manipulate it for their own purposes.  It's about how those stories were transformed via both jewish and christian institutions, processes and time, to arrive at what we understand the bible to be today.  There will need to be an exploration of how we got from the original genesis text to the state of christian nationalism in the US today.

It has to try and explain how we got here from there.
