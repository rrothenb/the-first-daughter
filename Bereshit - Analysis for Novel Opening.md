## Meaning

**Bereshit** (בְּרֵאשִׁית) - "In the beginning"

- First word of the Torah / Hebrew name for Genesis
- "be-" = "in" + "reshit" = "beginning/first" (related to "rosh" = head)
- Grammatical ambiguity: construct state could mean "In the beginning of God's creating..." rather than the definitive "In THE beginning, God created..."
- Traditional translation smooths this over, presenting creation as discrete moment rather than ongoing process
- Example of how authoritative framing closes down what the Hebrew might actually support

## Samyaza Opening Concept

Samyaza reflects on what a great first word "bereshit" is to start a book. What it means. How elegant it is. Why he can't top that.

### What this accomplishes

1. Establishes Samyaza as literary, reflective, self-aware narrator - thinking about *how* to tell a story
2. Signals the book is in conversation with Genesis
3. Creates tension - he admires the craft of a text that misrepresents him and everyone he cared about
4. "I can't top that" is disarming and humble, makes him more trustworthy as narrator
5. Poignant: a being who was *there* appreciating words used to describe events he witnessed - knowing those words have been weaponized for millennia
6. He can separate the craft from the propaganda

## Bereshit vs. "Once Upon a Time"

### Similarities

- Both are temporal markers functioning as narrative incantations
- Signal "settle in, a story is beginning"
- Create sense of distance from present moment
- Ritualistic, almost magical quality through repetition over centuries
- Establish that what follows is *origin* material
- Deceptively simple (short, common words) while doing heavy lifting

### Key Divergence: Truth Claims

**"Once upon a time"**
- Deliberately vague - *a* time, somewhere, who knows when
- Vagueness signals "this is fable, don't take it literally"
- Humble about its own status

**"Bereshit"**
- THE beginning, the FIRST beginning
- Maximalist - claims to be the opening line of reality itself
- A human author had the nerve to write the first word of existence
- The word *worked* - became sacred through repetition and belief

### For Samyaza

- He might appreciate "bereshit" like a perfectly executed magic trick - the audacity of it
- Could see it as the most successful "once upon a time" ever written
- A fairy tale that convinced people it wasn't one
